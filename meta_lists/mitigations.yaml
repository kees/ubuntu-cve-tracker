unprivileged-userns: |
   If not needed, disable the ability for unprivileged users
   to create namespaces. To do this temporarily, do:
     sudo sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0
   To disable across reboots, do:
     echo kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0 | \
     sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-disable-unpriv-userns.conf

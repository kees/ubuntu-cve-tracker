 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles python-toml
 mdeslaur> binaries when built. After updating python-toml, a no-change
 mdeslaur> rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-toml is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.

 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-packaging binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-packaging, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-packaging is bundled in the
 mdeslaur> python-pip package and needs to be patched.

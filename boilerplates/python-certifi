 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-certifi binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-certifi, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-certifi is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.

Notes:
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes
 eslerm> the grub2 package does not affect Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> Ubuntu Secure Boot and ESM do not cover i386
 eslerm| Note that key revocation is required to protect against
   local evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus) and that
   secureboot-db is not updated on ESM releases as doing so
   would revoke install media keys

Notes: 
 ccdm94> the embedded ujson code in pandas, eventhough containing similar
 ccdm94> content as the upstream ujson code, seems to have diverged from the
 ccdm94> ujson upstream project (they have fully forked ujson), since pandas
 ccdm94> upstream is maintaining their own ujson bug fixes and changes without
 ccdm94> re-syncing with the ujson upstream project. There is no indication
 ccdm94> the ujson fork, as used in pandas, is vulnerable to the same issues
 ccdm94> as the upstream ujson code.

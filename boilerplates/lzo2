Notes:
 alexmurray| grub2 has a vendored copy of minilzo which is part of lzo2 so
  likely any vulnerabilities that affect lzo2 may also affect minilzo in
  grub2 and hence grub2-signed - although this is being changed for F/G/H in
  LP #1911440 to use the distro minilzo but in this case grub2 vendors the
  distro's minilzo via Built-Using so it will still require a rebuild when
  updates for minilzo are published for these releases

Several packages in the Ubuntu archive produce false positives when they
are scanned with a virus scanner such as ClamAV.

This file documents the known false positives, along with a short
explanation.

To get this list updated, send an email to security@ubuntu.com with your
scan results.

The following online services can be used to attempt to verify whether
something is a false positive:

This is a multiplayer game. The upstream tarballs include a source file
named LiquidWarExploit.c that includes an exploit against 2003-era
Slackware and Gentoo builds of the liquidwar game. This exploit worked by

accepted as "not within the threat model" of most applications. This
exploit isn't built, and isn't present in the binary packages.

Windows-compatible executables. Our assumption is these are just useful
tools.

Some AV tools find the EICAR test file in this package. Good job! We're
all proud of you!

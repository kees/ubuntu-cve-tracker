Description:
  xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol (RDP) server. In versions
 prior to 0.9.23 improper handling of session establishment errors allows
 bypassing OS-level session restrictions. The `auth_start_session` function
 can return non-zero (1) value on, e.g., PAM error which may result in in
 session restrictions such as max concurrent sessions per user by PAM (ex
 ./etc/security/limits.conf) to be bypassed. Users (administrators) don't
 use restrictions by PAM are not affected. This issue has been addressed in
 release version 0.9.23. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this issue.

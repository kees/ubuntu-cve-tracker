 https://github.com/Daybreak2019/PoC_python3.9_Vul/blob/main/RecursionError-email.utils.parseaddr.py
Description:
 The legacy email.utils.parseaddr function in Python through 3.11.4 allows
 attackers to trigger "RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
 while calling a Python object" via a crafted argument. This argument is
 plausibly an untrusted value from an application's input data that was
 supposed to contain a name and an e-mail address. NOTE:
 email.utils.parseaddr is categorized as a Legacy API in the documentation
 of the Python email package. Applications should instead use the
 email.parser.BytesParser or email.parser.Parser class.

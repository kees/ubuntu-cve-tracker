Description:
 An Improper Output Neutralization for Logs flaw was found in Ansible when
 using the uri module, where sensitive data is exposed to content and json
 output. This flaw allows an attacker to access the logs or outputs of
 performed tasks to read keys used in playbooks from other users within the
 uri module. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
 confidentiality.

Description:
 An issue was discovered in HAProxy 2.0 before 2.0.24, 2.2 before 2.2.16,
 2.3 before 2.3.13, and 2.4 before 2.4.3. An HTTP method name may contain a
 space followed by the name of a protected resource. It is possible that a
 server would interpret this as a request for that protected resource, such
 as in the "GET /admin? HTTP/1.1 /static/images HTTP/1.1" example.

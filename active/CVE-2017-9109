Description:
 An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. It fails to ignore apparent
 answers before the first RR that was found the first time. when this is
 fixed, the second answer scan finds the same RRs at the first. Otherwise,
 adns can be confused by interleaving answers for the CNAME target, with the
 CNAME itself. In that case the answer data structure (on the heap) can be
 overrun. With this fixed, it prefers to look only at the answer RRs which
 come after the CNAME, which is at least arguably correct.

Description:
 When rendering with headless builds, show an error instead of crashing.
 Previously GPU_backend_init was called indirectly from
 DRW_opengl_context_create, a new function is now called from the window
 manager (GPU_backend_init_once), so it's possible to check if the GPU has a
 back-end. This also disables the bgl Python module when building
 WITH_HEADLESS.

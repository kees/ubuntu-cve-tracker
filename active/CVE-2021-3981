Description:
 A flaw in grub2 was found where its configuration file, known as grub.cfg,
 is being created with the wrong permission set allowing non privileged
 users to read its content. This represents a low severity confidentiality
 issue, as those users can eventually read any encrypted passwords present
 in grub.cfg.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> I'm not sure what this CVE is about. Our grub-mkconfig script
 mdeslaur> only makes grub.cfg world-readable if there is no password in
 mdeslaur> it. See also:

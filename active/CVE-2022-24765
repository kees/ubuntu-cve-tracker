Description:
 On multi-user machines, Git users might find themselves unexpectedly in a
 Git worktree, e.g. when there is a scratch space (`/scratch/`) intended for
 all users and another user created a repository in `/scratch/.git`.  Merely
 having a Git-aware prompt that runs `git status` (or `git diff`) and
 navigating to a directory which is supposedly not a Git worktree, or
 opening such a directory in an editor or IDE such as VS Code or Atom, will
 potentially run commands defined by that other user via
 `/scratch/.git/config`.

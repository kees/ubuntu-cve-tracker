Description:
 Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework. A
 path traversal vulnerability affects versions of Flatpak prior to 1.12.3
 and 1.10.6. flatpak-builder applies `finish-args` last in the build. At
 this point the build directory will have the full access that is specified
 in the manifest, so running `flatpak build` against it will gain those
 permissions. Normally this will not be done, so this is not problem.
 However, if `--mirror-screenshots-url` is specified, then flatpak-builder
 will launch `flatpak build --nofilesystem=host appstream-utils
 mirror-screenshots` after finalization, which can lead to issues even with
 the `--nofilesystem=host` protection. In normal use, the only issue is that
 these empty directories can be created wherever the user has write
 permissions. However, a malicious application could replace the
 `appstream-util` binary and potentially do something more hostile. This has
 been resolved in Flatpak 1.12.3 and 1.10.6 by changing the behaviour of
 `--nofilesystem=home` and `--nofilesystem=host`.

Description:
 Sanitize is an allowlist-based HTML and CSS sanitizer. Versions 5.0.0 and
 later, prior to 6.0.1, are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting. When
 Sanitize is configured with a custom allowlist that allows `noscript`
 elements, attackers are able to include arbitrary HTML, resulting in XSS
 (cross-site scripting) or other undesired behavior when that HTML is
 rendered in a browser. The default configurations do not allow `noscript`
 elements and are not vulnerable. This issue only affects users who are
 using a custom config that adds `noscript` to the element allowlist. This
 issue has been patched in version 6.0.1. Users who are unable to upgrade
 can prevent this issue by using one of Sanitize's default configs or by
 ensuring that their custom config does not include `noscript` in the
 element allowlist.

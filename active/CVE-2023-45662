Description:
 stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images. When
 `stbi_set_flip_vertically_on_load` is set to `TRUE` and `req_comp` is set
 to a number that doesn’t match the real number of components per pixel, the
 library attempts to flip the image vertically. A crafted image file can
 trigger `memcpy` out-of-bounds read because `bytes_per_pixel` used to
 calculate `bytes_per_row` doesn’t match the real image array dimensions.

 removing directory trees
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> The original issue associated with this CVE is issue 317,
 ccdm94> which provides a fix through commit dcca865. However, another
 ccdm94> pull request which references this issue was opened at a
 ccdm94> later date, this being PR 545. This pull request is said
 ccdm94> to actually address the issue while commit dcca865 was only
 ccdm94> a work around to the problem. Additionally, from the first
 ccdm94> comment that can be seen in PR 483, it seems like commit
 ccdm94> b447216 is also needed in order to completely fix this
 ccdm94> issue.
 ccdm94> Additionally, three commits fixing regressions introduced
 ccdm94> by one of the fix commits have been added after release
 ccdm94> 4.12.2, which is considered by upstream as the fixed release.
 ccdm94> These commit are: f3bdb28, 10cd68e and cde221b. They are
 ccdm94> a part of version 4.13 of shadow.

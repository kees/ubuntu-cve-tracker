Description:
 Node.js is vulnerable to Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Hijacking under certain
 conditions on Windows platforms.This vulnerability can be exploited if the
 victim has the following dependencies on a Windows machine:* OpenSSL has
 been installed and “C:\Program Files\Common Files\SSL\openssl.cnf”
 exists.Whenever the above conditions are present, `node.exe` will search
 for `providers.dll` in the current user directory.After that, `node.exe`
 will try to search for `providers.dll` by the DLL Search Order in
 Windows.It is possible for an attacker to place the malicious file
 `providers.dll` under a variety of paths and exploit this vulnerability.

Description:
 An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.25.0 (and before 2.16.9 LTS
 and before 2.7.18 LTS). A NULL algorithm parameters entry looks identical
 to an array of REAL (size zero) and thus the certificate is considered
 valid. However, if the parameters do not match in any way, then the
 certificate should be considered invalid.

Description:
 An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 4.5.0, when single precision is
 not employed. Local attackers can conduct a cache-timing attack against
 public key operations. These attackers may already have obtained sensitive
 information if the affected system has been used for private key operations
 (e.g., signing with a private key).

Description:
 In autofile Audio File Library 0.3.6, there exists one memory leak
 vulnerability in printfileinfo, in printinfo.c, which allows an attacker to
 leak sensitive information via a crafted file. The printfileinfo function
 calls the copyrightstring function to get data, however, it dosn't use zero
 bytes to truncate the data.

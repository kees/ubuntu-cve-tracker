Description:
 A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the Tulip device emulation in QEMU.
 When Tulip reads or writes to the rx/tx descriptor or copies the rx/tx
 frame, it doesn't check whether the destination address is its own MMIO
 address. This can cause the device to trigger MMIO handlers multiple times,
 possibly leading to a stack or heap overflow. A malicious guest could use
 this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of
 service condition.

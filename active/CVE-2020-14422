 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4428-1
Description:
 Lib/ipaddress.py in Python through 3.8.3 improperly computes hash values in
 the IPv4Interface and IPv6Interface classes, which might allow a remote
 attacker to cause a denial of service if an application is affected by the
 performance of a dictionary containing IPv4Interface or IPv6Interface
 objects, and this attacker can cause many dictionary entries to be created.
 This is fixed in: v3.5.10, v3.5.10rc1; v3.6.12; v3.7.9; v3.8.4, v3.8.4rc1,
 v3.8.5, v3.8.6, v3.8.6rc1; v3.9.0, v3.9.0b4, v3.9.0b5, v3.9.0rc1,
 v3.9.0rc2.

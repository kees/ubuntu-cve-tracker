Description:
 The Apache Bookkeeper Java Client (before 4.14.6 and also 4.15.0) does not
 close the connection to the bookkeeper server when TLS hostname
 verification fails. This leaves the bookkeeper client vulnerable to a man
 in the middle attack. The problem affects BookKeeper client prior to
 versions 4.14.6 and 4.15.1.

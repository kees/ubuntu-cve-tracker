Description:
 Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the
 Matrix.org Foundation. Prior to version 1.94.0, a malicious server ACL
 event can impact performance temporarily or permanently leading to a
 persistent denial of service. Homeservers running on a closed federation
 (which presumably do not need to use server ACLs) are not affected. Server
 administrators are advised to upgrade to Synapse 1.94.0 or later. As a
 workaround, rooms with malicious server ACL events can be purged and
 blocked using the admin API.

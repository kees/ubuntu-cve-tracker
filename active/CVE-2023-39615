Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Xmlsoft Libxml2 v2.11.0 was discovered to contain an
 out-of-bounds read via the xmlSAX2StartElement() function at
 /libxml2/SAX2.c. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of
 Service (DoS) via supplying a crafted XML file. NOTE: the vendor's position
 is that the product does not support the legacy SAX1 interface with custom
 callbacks; there is a crash even without crafted input.

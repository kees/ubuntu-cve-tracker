Description:
 Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation that
 is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption
 vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within the
 URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted template
 may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of
 service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not
 normally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous
 security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users
 of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template
 capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0.
 As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that
 have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.

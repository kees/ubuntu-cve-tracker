Description:
 ecdsautils is a tiny collection of programs used for ECDSA (keygen, sign,
 verify). `ecdsa_verify_[prepare_]legacy()` does not check whether the
 signature values `r` and `s` are non-zero. A signature consisting only of
 zeroes is always considered valid, making it trivial to forge signatures.
 Requiring multiple signatures from different public keys does not mitigate
 the issue: `ecdsa_verify_list_legacy()` will accept an arbitrary number of
 such forged signatures. Both the `ecdsautil verify` CLI command and the
 libecdsautil library are affected. The issue has been fixed in ecdsautils
 0.4.1. All older versions of ecdsautils (including versions before the
 split into a library and a CLI utility) are vulnerable.

Description:
 Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources, Unrestricted Upload
 of File with Dangerous Type, Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted
 Control Sphere vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr:
 from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.
 In the affected versions, Solr ConfigSets accepted Java jar and class files
 to be uploaded through the ConfigSets API.
 When backing up Solr Collections, these configSet files would be saved to
 disk when using the LocalFileSystemRepository (the default for backups).
 If the backup was saved to a directory that Solr uses in its
 ClassPath/ClassLoaders, then the jar and class files would be available to
 use with any ConfigSet, trusted or untrusted.

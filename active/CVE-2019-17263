Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** In libyal libfwsi before 20191006,
 libfwsi_extension_block_copy_from_byte_stream in libfwsi_extension_block.c
 has a heap-based buffer over-read because rejection of an unsupported size
 only considers values less than 6, even though values of 6 and 7 are also
 unsupported. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this as described in the GitHub
 issue.

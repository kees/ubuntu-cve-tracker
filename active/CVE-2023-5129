Description:
 With a specially crafted WebP lossless file, libwebp may write data out of
 bounds to the heap.
 
 The ReadHuffmanCodes() function allocates the HuffmanCode buffer with a
 size that comes from an array of precomputed sizes: kTableSize. The
 color_cache_bits value defines which size to use.
 
 The kTableSize array only takes into account sizes for 8-bit first-level
 table lookups but not second-level table lookups. libwebp allows codes that
 are up to 15-bit (MAX_ALLOWED_CODE_LENGTH). When BuildHuffmanTable()
 attempts to fill the second-level tables it may write data out-of-bounds.
 The OOB write to the undersized array happens in ReplicateValue.

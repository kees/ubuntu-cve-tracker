Description:
 Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Prior to
 version 23.10.0rc1, when sending multiple HTTP requests in one TCP packet,
 twisted.web will process the requests asynchronously without guaranteeing
 the response order. If one of the endpoints is controlled by an attacker,
 the attacker can delay the response on purpose to manipulate the response
 of the second request when a victim launched two requests using HTTP
 pipeline. Version 23.10.0rc1 contains a patch for this issue.

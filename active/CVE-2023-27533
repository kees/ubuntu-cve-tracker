Description:
 A vulnerability in input validation exists in curl <8.0 during
 communication using the TELNET protocol may allow an attacker to pass on
 maliciously crafted user name and "telnet options" during server
 negotiation. The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send
 content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent.
 This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user input,
 thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.

Description:
 Nextcloud desktop is the desktop sync client for Nextcloud. Versions prior
 to 3.6.1 would incorrectly trust invalid TLS certificates. A
 Man-in-the-middle attack is possible in case a user can be made running a
 nextcloudcmd CLI command locally. It is recommended that the Nextcloud
 Desktop client is upgraded to 3.6.1. There are no known workarounds for
 this vulnerability.

Description:
 OpenSSH through 8.7 allows remote attackers, who have a suspicion that a
 certain combination of username and public key is known to an SSH server,
 to test whether this suspicion is correct. This occurs because a challenge
 is sent only when that combination could be valid for a login session.
Ubuntu-Description:

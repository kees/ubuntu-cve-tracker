Description:
 The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo did not respect the umask
 when extracting crate archives on UNIX-like systems. If the user downloaded a
 crate containing files writeable by any local user, another local user could
 exploit this to change the source code compiled and executed by the current user.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> cargo in mantic was merged into rustc
 alexmurray> requires an update to the tar rust dependency (tar 0.4.39) - this
   is packaged as rust-tar in Ubuntu but only the rust-cargo package appears to
   use this - rustc and cargo both vendor a copy of this package
 litios> a workaround for this issue is to prevent access to the ~/.cargo
   directory to other users.

Description:
 HylaFAX+ through 7.0.2 and HylaFAX Enterprise have scripts that execute
 binaries from directories writable by unprivileged users (e.g., locations
 under /var/spool/hylafax that are writable by the uucp account). This
 allows these users to execute code in the context of the user calling these
 binaries (often root).

Description:
 [Netatalk setfilparams Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution
 Vulnerability

 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
 affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to
 exploit this vulnerability.

 The specific flaw exists within the setfilparams function. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied
 data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker
 can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.]

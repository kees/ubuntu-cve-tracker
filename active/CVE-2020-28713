Description:
 Incorrect access control in push notification service in Night Owl Smart
 Doorbell FW version 20190505 allows remote users to send push notification
 events via an exposed PNS server. A remote attacker can passively record
 push notification events which are sent over an insecure web request. The
 web service does not authenticate requests, and allows attackers to send an
 indefinite amount of motion or doorbell events to a user's mobile
 application by either replaying or deliberately crafting false events.

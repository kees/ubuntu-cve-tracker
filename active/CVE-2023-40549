Description:
 [Authenticode: verify that the signature header is in bounds.
 In the validation logic in verify_buffer_authenticode(), there is yet
 another case where we need to guarantee an object is in the binary but
 we're only validating the pointer to it.  In this case, we're validating
 that the actual signature data is in the binary, but unfortunately we
 failed to validate that the header describing it is, so a malformed
 binary can cause us to take an out-of-bounds read (probably but not
 necessarily on the same page) past the end of the buffer.
 This patch adds a bounds check to verify that the signature is
 actually within the bounds.
 It seems unlikely this can be used for more than a denial of service,
 and if you can get shim to try to verify a malformed binary, you've
 effectively already accomplished a DoS.]

 eslerm> secureboot-db should only ever be updated after shim
 eslerm> secureboot-db is not updated on ESM releases as doing so would
 eslerm> revoke install media keys Note that key revocation is required to
 eslerm> protect against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)

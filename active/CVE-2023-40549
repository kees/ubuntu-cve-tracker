Description:
 An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in Shim due to the lack of proper
 boundary verification during the load of a PE binary. This flaw allows an
 attacker to load a crafted PE binary, triggering the issue and crashing
 Shim, resulting in a denial of service.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> UEFI Security Response Team states that dbx update is not needed
 eslerm> secureboot-db should only ever be updated after shim
 eslerm> secureboot-db is not updated on ESM releases as doing so would
 eslerm> revoke install media keys Note that key revocation is required to
 eslerm> protect against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)

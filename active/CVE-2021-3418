Description: 
 The GRUB2 upstream reintroduced the CVE-2020-15705. This refers to
 a distro specific flaw which made upstream in the mentioned version.
 .
 If certificates that signed GRUB2 are installed into db, GRUB2 can
 be booted directly. It will then boot any kernel without signature
 validation.  The booted kernel will think it was booted in Secure Boot
 mode and will implement lock down, yet it could have been tampered.
 .
 This flaw only affects upstream and distributions using the shim_lock
 verifier.

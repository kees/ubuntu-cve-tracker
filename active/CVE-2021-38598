Description:
 OpenStack Neutron before 16.4.1, 17.x before 17.1.3, and 18.0.0 allows
 hardware address impersonation when the linuxbridge driver with
 ebtables-nft is used on a Netfilter-based platform. By sending carefully
 crafted packets, anyone in control of a server instance connected to the
 virtual switch can impersonate the hardware addresses of other systems on
 the network, resulting in denial of service or in some cases possibly
 interception of traffic intended for other destinations.

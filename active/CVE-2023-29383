Description:
 In Shadow 4.13, it is possible to inject control characters into fields
 provided to the SUID program chfn (change finger). Although it is not
 possible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \n
 is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd file
 when viewed. Use of \r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around
 blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a
 new user has been added. In other words, an adversary may be able to
 convince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect,
 social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that "cat
 /etc/passwd" shows a rogue user account.

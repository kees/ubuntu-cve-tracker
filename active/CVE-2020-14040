Description:
 The x/text package before 0.3.3 for Go has a vulnerability in
 encoding/unicode that could lead to the UTF-16 decoder entering an infinite
 loop, causing the program to crash or run out of memory. An attacker could
 provide a single byte to a UTF16 decoder instantiated with UseBOM or
 ExpectBOM to trigger an infinite loop if the String function on the Decoder
 is called, or the Decoder is passed to golang.org/x/text/transform.String.

Description:
 An issue was discovered in the selinux-policy (aka Reference Policy)
 package 3.14 through 2020-08-24 because the .config/Yubico directory is
 mishandled. Consequently, when SELinux is in enforced mode, pam-u2f is not
 allowed to read the user's U2F configuration file. If configured with the
 nouserok option (the default when configured by the authselect tool), and
 that file cannot be read, the second factor is disabled. An attacker with
 only the knowledge of the password can then log in, bypassing 2FA.

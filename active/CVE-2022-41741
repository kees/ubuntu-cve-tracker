Description:
 NGINX Open Source before versions 1.23.2 and 1.22.1, NGINX Open Source
 Subscription before versions R2 P1 and R1 P1, and NGINX Plus before
 versions R27 P1 and R26 P1 have a vulnerability in the module
 ngx_http_mp4_module that might allow a local attacker to corrupt NGINX
 worker memory, resulting in its termination or potential other impact using
 a specially crafted audio or video file. The issue affects only NGINX
 products that are built with the ngx_http_mp4_module, when the mp4
 directive is used in the configuration file. Further, the attack is
 possible only if an attacker can trigger processing of a specially crafted
 audio or video file with the module ngx_http_mp4_module.

Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. In Cacti 1.2.24, users with console access can be redirected to
 an arbitrary website after a change password performed via a specifically
 crafted URL. The `auth_changepassword.php` file accepts `ref` as a URL
 parameter and reflects it in the form used to perform the change password.
 It's value is used to perform a redirect via `header` PHP function. A user
 can be tricked in performing the change password operation, e.g., via a
 phishing message, and then interacting with the malicious website where the
 redirection has been performed, e.g., downloading malwares, providing
 credentials, etc. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users
 are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.

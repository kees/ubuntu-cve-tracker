Description:
 LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds write in _TIFFmemcpy in
 libtiff/tif_unix.c:346 when called from extractImageSection,
 tools/tiffcrop.c:6860, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via
 a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix
 is available with commit 236b7191.

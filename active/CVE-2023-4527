Description:
 A flaw was found in glibc. When the getaddrinfo function is called with the
 AF_UNSPEC address family and the system is configured with no-aaaa mode via
 /etc/resolv.conf, a DNS response via TCP larger than 2048 bytes can
 potentially disclose stack contents through the function returned address
 data, and may cause a crash.

Description:
 An issue was discovered in the rack-cors (aka Rack CORS Middleware) gem
 before 1.0.4 for Ruby. It allows ../ directory traversal to access private
 resources because resource matching does not ensure that pathnames are in a
 canonical format.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that rack-cors did not properly handle relative file paths.
 An attacker could use this vulnerability to access arbitrary files.

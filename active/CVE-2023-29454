Description:
  Stored or persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of XSS where the
 attacker first sends the payload to the web application, then the
 application saves the payload (e.g., in a database or server-side text
 files), and finally, the application unintentionally executes the payload
 for every victim visiting its web pages.

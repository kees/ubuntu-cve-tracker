Description:
 Nullptr dereference when a null char is present in a proto symbol. The
 symbol is parsed incorrectly, leading to an unchecked call into the proto
 file's name during generation of the resulting error message. Since the
 symbol is incorrectly parsed, the file is nullptr. We recommend upgrading
 to version 3.15.0 or greater.

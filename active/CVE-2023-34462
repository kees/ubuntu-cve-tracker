Description:
 Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for
 rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers &
 clients. The `SniHandler` can allocate up to 16MB of heap for each channel
 during the TLS handshake. When the handler or the channel does not have an
 idle timeout, it can be used to make a TCP server using the `SniHandler` to
 allocate 16MB of heap. The `SniHandler` class is a handler that waits for
 the TLS handshake to configure a `SslHandler` according to the indicated
 server name by the `ClientHello` record. For this matter it allocates a
 `ByteBuf` using the value defined in the `ClientHello` record. Normally the
 value of the packet should be smaller than the handshake packet but there
 are not checks done here and the way the code is written, it is possible to
 craft a packet that makes the `SslClientHelloHandler`. This vulnerability
 has been fixed in version 4.1.94.Final.

Description:
 Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
 deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read
 was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is
 triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file.
 An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial
 of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted
 image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.

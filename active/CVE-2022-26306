Description:
 LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the
 userâ€™s configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a
 single master key provided by the user. A flaw in LibreOffice existed where
 the required initialization vector for encryption was always the same which
 weakens the security of the encryption making them vulnerable if an
 attacker has access to the user's configuration data. This issue affects:
 The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.7; 7.3
 versions prior to 7.3.1.

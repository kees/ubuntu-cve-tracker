Description:
 [race condition in Tang exposes private keys to other processes]
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> For tang 6 and 7 in bionic and focal respectively, the code
  from src/keys.c and src/tangd-rotate-keys.in is not present, however there
  is an equivalent src/tangd-keygen script which looks like it needs to be
  updated to set the umask correctly

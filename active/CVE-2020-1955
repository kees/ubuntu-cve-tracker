Description:
 CouchDB version 3.0.0 shipped with a new configuration setting that governs
 access control to the entire database server called
 `require_valid_user_except_for_up`. It was meant as an extension to the
 long standing setting `require_valid_user`, which in turn requires that any
 and all requests to CouchDB will have to be made with valid credentials,
 effectively forbidding any anonymous requests. The new
 `require_valid_user_except_for_up` is an off-by-default setting that was
 meant to allow requiring valid credentials for all endpoints except for the
 `/_up` endpoint. However, the implementation of this made an error that
 lead to not enforcing credentials on any endpoint, when enabled. CouchDB
 versions 3.0.1[1] and 3.1.0[2] fix this issue.

Description:
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
 affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to
 exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
 dsi_writeinit function. The issue results from the lack of proper
 validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a
 fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability
 to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-17646.

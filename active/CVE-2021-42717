Description:
 ModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.5 mishandles excessively nested JSON objects.
 Crafted JSON objects with nesting tens-of-thousands deep could result in
 the web server being unable to service legitimate requests. Even a
 moderately large (e.g., 300KB) HTTP request can occupy one of the limited
 NGINX worker processes for minutes and consume almost all of the available
 CPU on the machine. Modsecurity 2 is similarly vulnerable: the affected
 versions include 2.8.0 through 2.9.4.

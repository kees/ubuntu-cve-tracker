Description:
 Python 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in
 _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to remote code execution in certain
 Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted input,
 as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs
 because sprintf is used unsafely.

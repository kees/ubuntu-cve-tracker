Description:
 GLPI is a free Asset and IT management software package. In versions prior
 to 9.5.6, the cookie used to store the autologin cookie (when a user uses
 the "remember me" feature) is accessible by scripts. A malicious plugin
 that could steal this cookie would be able to use it to autologin. This
 issue is fixed in version 9.5.6. As a workaround, one may avoid using the
 "remember me" feature.

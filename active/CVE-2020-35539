Description:
 A flaw was found in Wordpress 5.1. "X-Forwarded-For" is a HTTP header used
 to carry the client's original IP address. However, because these headers
 may very well be added by the client to the requests, if the
 systems/devices use IP addresses which decelerate at X-Forwarded-For header
 instead of original IP, various issues may be faced. If the data
 originating from these fields is trusted by the application developers and
 processed, any authorization checks originating IP address logging could be
 manipulated.

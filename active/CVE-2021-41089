Description: 
 A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where attempting to copy
 files using `docker cp` into a specially-crafted container can
 result in Unix file permission changes for existing files in the
 host's filesystem, widening access to others.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Lei Wang and Ruizhi Xiao discovered that the Moby Docker engine
 subsystem in Docker incorrectly allowed the docker cp command to
 make permissions changes in the host filesystem in some situations. A
 local attacker could possibly use to this to expose sensitive
 information or gain administrative privileges.

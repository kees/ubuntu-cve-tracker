Description:
 An issue was discovered in the Clario VPN client through 5.9.1.1662 for
 macOS. The VPN client insecurely configures the operating system such that
 traffic to the local network is sent in plaintext outside the VPN tunnel
 even if the local network is using a non-RFC1918 IP subnet. This allows an
 adversary to trick the victim into sending arbitrary IP traffic in
 plaintext outside the VPN tunnel. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com
 website uses this CVE ID to refer more generally to "LocalNet attack
 resulting in leakage of traffic in plaintext" rather than to only Clario.

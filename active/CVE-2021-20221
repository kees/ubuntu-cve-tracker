Description:
 An out-of-bounds heap buffer access issue was found in the ARM Generic
 Interrupt Controller emulator of QEMU on aarch64 platform. The issue occurs
 because while writing an interrupt ID to the controller memory area, it is
 not masked to be 4 bits wide. It may lead to the said issue while updating
 controller state fields and their subsequent processing. A privileged guest
 user may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in
 DoS scenario.

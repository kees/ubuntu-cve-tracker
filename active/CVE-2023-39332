Candidate: CVE-2023-39332

 https://hackerone.com/reports/2199818
Description:
 Various `node:fs` functions allow specifying paths as either strings or
 `Uint8Array` objects. In Node.js environments, the `Buffer` class extends
 the `Uint8Array` class. Node.js prevents path traversal through strings
 (see CVE-2023-30584) and `Buffer` objects (see CVE-2023-32004), but not
 through non-`Buffer` `Uint8Array` objects.
 
 This is distinct from CVE-2023-32004 ([report
 2038134](https://hackerone.com/reports/2038134)), which only referred to
 `Buffer` objects. However, the vulnerability follows the same pattern using
 `Uint8Array` instead of `Buffer`.
 
 Impacts:
 
 This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission
 model in Node.js 20.
 
 Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is
 an experimental feature of Node.js.

 https://github.com/Mindwerks/wildmidi/commit/660b513d99bced8783a4a5984ac2f742c74ebbdd
Description:
 The _WM_SetupMidiEvent function in internal_midi.c:2315 in WildMIDI 0.4.2
 can cause a denial of service (invalid memory read and application crash)
 via a crafted mid file.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that WildMIDI incorrectly handled certain MID files. A
 remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.
Notes:
 ebarretto> Looking at the patches and the version on Trusty, it seems like
 ebarretto> some of the patches are not appliable and others are tricky to
 ebarretto> backport. So considering really low for Trusty.

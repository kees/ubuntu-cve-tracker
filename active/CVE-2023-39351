Description:
 FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP),
 released under the Apache license. Affected versions of FreeRDP are subject
 to a Null Pointer Dereference leading a crash in the RemoteFX (rfx)
 handling. Inside the `rfx_process_message_tileset` function, the program
 allocates tiles using `rfx_allocate_tiles` for the number of numTiles. If
 the initialization process of tiles is not completed for various reasons,
 tiles will have a NULL pointer. Which may be accessed in further processing
 and would cause a program crash. This issue has been addressed in versions
 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.

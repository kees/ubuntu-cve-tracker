Description:
 moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating,
 and formatting dates. Affected versions of moment were found to use an
 inefficient parsing algorithm. Specifically using string-to-date parsing in
 moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) has
 quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs. Users may notice a
 noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters. Users who
 pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment
 constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. The problem is patched in
 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal
 tweaking. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should
 consider limiting date lengths accepted from user input.

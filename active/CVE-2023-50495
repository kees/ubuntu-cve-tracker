Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This is in the code that parses terminfo database files when the
 mdeslaur> tic tool is used. terminfo files are normally trusted, and since
 mdeslaur> the fix for CVE-2023-29491, we no longer parse terminfo files
 mdeslaur> when apps are setuid. As such, this doesn't really have a
 mdeslaur> security impact.
 mdeslaur> Setting priority to low.

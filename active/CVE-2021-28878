Description:
 In the standard library in Rust before 1.52.0, the Zip implementation calls
 __iterator_get_unchecked() more than once for the same index (under certain
 conditions) when next_back() and next() are used together. This bug could
 lead to a memory safety violation due to an unmet safety requirement for
 the TrustedRandomAccess trait.

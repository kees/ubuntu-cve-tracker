Description:
 Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a
 heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When executing a `:s` command for the
 very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the
 substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes
 free-ing of memory which may later then be accessed by the initial `:s`
 command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the whole
 process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the
 very first :s command. It may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121
 contains a fix for this issue.

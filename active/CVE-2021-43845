Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library. In
 version 2.11.1 and prior, if incoming RTCP XR message contain block, the
 data field is not checked against the received packet size, potentially
 resulting in an out-of-bound read access. This affects all users that use
 PJMEDIA and RTCP XR. A malicious actor can send a RTCP XR message with an
 invalid packet size.

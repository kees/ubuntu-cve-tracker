Description: 
 Dnsmasq versions before 2.83 is susceptible to a heap-based buffer
 overflow in sort_rrset() when DNSSEC is used. This can allow a remote
 attacker to write arbitrary data into target device's memory that can lead
 to memory corruption and other unexpected behaviors on the target device.

Description:
 cmark-gfm is GitHub's fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and rendering
 library and program in C. Versions prior to 0.29.0.gfm.7 are subject to
 several polynomial time complexity issues in cmark-gfm that may lead to
 unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. Various
 commands, when piped to cmark-gfm with large values, cause the running time
 to increase quadratically. These vulnerabilities have been patched in
 version 0.29.0.gfm.7.

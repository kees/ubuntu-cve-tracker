Description:
 Libgcrypt before 1.8.8 and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 mishandles ElGamal encryption
 because it lacks exponent blinding to address a side-channel attack against
 mpi_powm, and the window size is not chosen appropriately. (There is also
 an interoperability problem because the selection of the k integer value
 does not properly consider the differences between basic ElGamal encryption
 and generalized ElGamal encryption.) This, for example, affects use of
 ElGamal in OpenPGP.

Description:
 Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. Prior to
 RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z, an attacker can use crafted requests to
 bypass metadata bucket name checking and put an object into any bucket
 while processing `PostPolicyBucket`. To carry out this attack, the attacker
 requires credentials with `arn:aws:s3:::*` permission, as well as enabled
 Console API access. This issue has been patched in
 RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z. As a workaround, enable browser API access
 and turn off `MINIO_BROWSER=off`.

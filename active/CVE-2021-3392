Description:
 A use-after-free flaw was found in the MegaRAID emulator of QEMU. This
 issue occurs while processing SCSI I/O requests in the case of an error
 mptsas_free_request() that does not dequeue the request object 'req' from a
 pending requests queue. This flaw allows a privileged guest user to crash
 the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service. Versions
 between 2.10.0 and 5.2.0 are potentially affected.

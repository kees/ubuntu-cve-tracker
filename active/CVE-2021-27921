 https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasenotes/8.1.1.html
Description:
 Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 consumption) because the reported size of a contained image is not properly
 checked for a BLP container, and thus an attempted memory allocation can be
 very large.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> while this is mentioned in the 8.1.1 release notes, it doesn't
 mdeslaur> seem to be mentioned in the CHANGES file, and I can't seem to
 mdeslaur> locate the commits that fix this in 8.1.1 vs 8.1.0
 mdeslaur> This was actually fixed in 8.1.2.

 https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasenotes/8.1.1.html
Description:
 Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 consumption) because the reported size of a contained image is not properly
 checked for a BLP container, and thus an attempted memory allocation can be
 very large.

Description:
 An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.24.0. The verification of
 X.509 certificates when matching the expected common name (the cn argument
 of mbedtls_x509_crt_verify) with the actual certificate name is mishandled:
 when the subjecAltName extension is present, the expected name is compared
 to any name in that extension regardless of its type. This means that an
 attacker could impersonate a 4-byte or 16-byte domain by getting a
 certificate for the corresponding IPv4 or IPv6 address (this would require
 the attacker to control that IP address, though).

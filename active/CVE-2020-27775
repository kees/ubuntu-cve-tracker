Description:
 A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/quantum.h. An attacker who
 submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
 undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type unsigned
 char. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability,
 but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.
 This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.

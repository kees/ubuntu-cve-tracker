Description:
 Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users
 issuing specially crafted `SRANDMEMBER`, `ZRANDMEMBER`, and `HRANDFIELD`
 commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting in a runtime assertion
 and termination of the Redis server process. This problem affects all Redis
 versions. Patches were released in Redis version(s) 6.0.18, 6.2.11 and
 7.0.9.

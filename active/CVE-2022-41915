Description:
 Netty project is an event-driven asynchronous network application
 framework. Starting in version 4.1.83.Final and prior to 4.1.86.Final, when
 calling `DefaultHttpHeadesr.set` with an _iterator_ of values, header value
 validation was not performed, allowing malicious header values in the
 iterator to perform HTTP Response Splitting. This issue has been patched in
 version 4.1.86.Final. Integrators can work around the issue by changing the
 `DefaultHttpHeaders.set(CharSequence, Iterator<?>)` call, into a `remove()`
 call, and call `add()` in a loop over the iterator of values.

Description:
 An HTTP Request Forgery issue was discovered in Varnish Cache 5.x and 6.x
 before 6.0.11, 7.x before 7.1.2, and 7.2.x before 7.2.1. An attacker may
 introduce characters through HTTP/2 pseudo-headers that are invalid in the
 context of an HTTP/1 request line, causing the Varnish server to produce
 invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This could, in turn, be used to
 exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind the Varnish server. Note: the
 6.0.x LTS series (before 6.0.11) is affected.

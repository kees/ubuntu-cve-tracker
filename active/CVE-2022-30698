Description:
 NLnet Labs Unbound, up to and including version 1.16.1 is vulnerable to a
 novel type of the "ghost domain names" attack. The vulnerability works by
 targeting an Unbound instance. Unbound is queried for a subdomain of a
 rogue domain name. The rogue nameserver returns delegation information for
 the subdomain that updates Unbound's delegation cache. This action can be
 repeated before expiry of the delegation information by querying Unbound
 for a second level subdomain which the rogue nameserver provides new
 delegation information. Since Unbound is a child-centric resolver, the
 ever-updating child delegation information can keep a rogue domain name
 resolvable long after revocation. From version 1.16.2 on, Unbound checks
 the validity of parent delegation records before using cached delegation
 information.

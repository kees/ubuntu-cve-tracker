Description:
 etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10 does not perform any password length
 validation, which allows for very short passwords, such as those with a
 length of one. This may allow an attacker to guess or brute-force users'
 passwords with little computational effort.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ebarretto> No fix available:
 ebarretto> The etcdctl and etcd API do not enforce a specific password
 ebarretto> length during user creation or user password update operations.
 ebarretto> It is the responsibility of the administrator to enforce these
 ebarretto> requirements.

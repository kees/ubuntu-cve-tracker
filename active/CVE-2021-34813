Description:
 Matrix libolm before 3.2.3 allows a malicious Matrix homeserver to crash a
 client (while it is attempting to retrieve an Olm encrypted room key backup
 from the homeserver) because olm_pk_decrypt has a stack-based buffer
 overflow. Remote code execution might be possible for some nonstandard
 build configurations.

Description:
 Use after free in client key_share extension
 It was found that the client sending a "key_share" or "pre_share_key"
 extension may result in dereferencing a pointer no longer valid after
 realloc(). This only happens in TLS 1.3 and only when the client sends a
 large Client Hello message, e.g., when HRR is sent in a resumed session
 previously negotiated large FFDHE parameters, because the initial
 allocation of the buffer is large enough without having to call realloc().

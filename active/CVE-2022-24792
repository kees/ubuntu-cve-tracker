Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 C. A denial-of-service vulnerability affects applications on a 32-bit
 systems that use PJSIP versions 2.12 and prior to play/read invalid WAV
 files. The vulnerability occurs when reading WAV file data chunks with
 length greater than 31-bit integers. The vulnerability does not affect
 64-bit apps and should not affect apps that only plays trusted WAV files. A
 patch is available on the `master` branch of the `pjsip/project` GitHub
 repository. As a workaround, apps can reject a WAV file received from an
 unknown source or validate the file first.

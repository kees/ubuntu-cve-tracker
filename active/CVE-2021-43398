Description:
 Crypto++ (aka Cryptopp) 8.6.0 and earlier contains a timing leakage in
 MakePublicKey(). There is a clear correlation between execution time and
 private key length, which may cause disclosure of the length information of
 the private key. This might allow attackers to conduct timing attacks.

Description:
 A flaw was found in pki-core, which could allow a user to get a certificate
 for another user identity when directory-based authentication is enabled.
 This flaw allows an authenticated attacker on the adjacent network to
 impersonate another user within the scope of the domain, but they would not
 be able to decrypt message content.

Description:
 LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the
 userâ€™s configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a
 single master key provided by the user. A flaw in LibreOffice existed where
 master key was poorly encoded resulting in weakening its entropy from 128
 to 43 bits making the stored passwords vulerable to a brute force attack if
 an attacker has access to the users stored config. This issue affects: The
 Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.7; 7.3 versions
 prior to 7.3.3.

Description:
 A flaw was found in Undertow. When an AJP request is sent that exceeds the
 max-header-size attribute in ajp-listener, JBoss EAP is marked in an error
 state by mod_cluster in httpd, causing JBoss EAP to close the TCP
 connection without returning an AJP response. This happens because
 mod_proxy_cluster marks the JBoss EAP instance as an error worker when the
 TCP connection is closed from the backend after sending the AJP request
 without receiving an AJP response, and stops forwarding. This issue could
 allow a malicious user could to repeatedly send requests that exceed the
 max-header-size, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).

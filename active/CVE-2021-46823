Description:
 python-ldap before 3.4.0 is vulnerable to a denial of service when
 ldap.schema is used for untrusted schema definitions, because of a regular
 expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw in the LDAP schema parser. By
 sending crafted regex input, a remote authenticated attacker could exploit
 this vulnerability to cause a denial of service condition.

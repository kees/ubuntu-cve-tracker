Description:
 Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript.
 Starting with version 17.1.0-rc.1, improperly formed beacon events can
 disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially
 impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the
 matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or
 corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This is patched in
 matrix-js-sdk v19.7.0. Redacting applicable events, waiting for the sync
 processor to store data, and restarting the client are possible
 workarounds. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing
 all storage will fix the further perceived issues. Downgrading to an
 unaffected version, noting that such a version may be subject to other
 vulnerabilities, will additionally resolve the issue.

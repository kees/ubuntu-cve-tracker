Description: 
 A bug was found in containerd where pulling and extracting a specially-
 crafted container image can result in Unix file permission changes for
 existing files in the hostâ€™s filesystem. Changes to file permissions can
 deny access to the expected owner of the file, widen access to others, or
 set extended bits like setuid, setgid, and sticky. This bug does not
 directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed without an
 additional cooperating process.

Description:
 avahi-daemon-check-dns.sh in the Debian avahi package through 0.8-4 is
 executed as root via /etc/network/if-up.d/avahi-daemon, and allows a local
 attacker to cause a denial of service or create arbitrary empty files via a
 symlink attack on files under /run/avahi-daemon. NOTE: this only affects
 the packaging for Debian GNU/Linux (used indirectly by SUSE), not the
 upstream Avahi product.

Description:
 It was discovered that yum-updatesd did not properly perform RPM package
 signature checks. When yum-updatesd was configured to automatically install
 updates, a remote attacker could use this flaw to install a malicious
 update on the target system using an unsigned RPM or an RPM signed with an
 untrusted key.

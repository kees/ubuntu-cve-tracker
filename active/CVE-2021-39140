Description:
 XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In
 affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to
 allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or
 parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only
 by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who
 followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a
 whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no
 longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general
 purpose.

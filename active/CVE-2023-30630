Description:
 Dmidecode before 3.5 allows -dump-bin to overwrite a local file. This has
 security relevance because, for example, execution of Dmidecode via Sudo is
 plausible.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> cpu-x embedds dmidecode source
 mdeslaur> This CVE relies on an improbable non-default configuration of
 mdeslaur> allowing an unprivileged user to run demidecode under sudo with
 mdeslaur> a specific insecure configuration in the sudoers file. Using
 mdeslaur> dmidecode in such a manner is no different than allowing any
 mdeslaur> other tool to unexpectedly run with elevated privileges. Setting
 mdeslaur> priority to low.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The upstream commits listed below only prevent overwriting a
 mdeslaur> file as root, but still allows creating arbitrary files as root
 mdeslaur> so using dmidecode with elevated privileges via sudoers is still
 mdeslaur> unsafe.
Mitigation:
 Do not configure sudoers file to allow running dmidecode with elevated
 privileges.

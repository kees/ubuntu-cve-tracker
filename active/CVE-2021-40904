Description:
 The web management console of CheckMK Raw Edition (versions 1.5.0 to 1.6.0)
 allows a misconfiguration of the web-app Dokuwiki (installed by default),
 which allows embedded php code. As a result, remote code execution is
 achieved. Successful exploitation requires access to the web management
 interface, either with valid credentials or with a hijacked session by a
 user with the role of administrator.

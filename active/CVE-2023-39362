Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. In Cacti 1.2.24, under certain conditions, an authenticated
 privileged user, can use a malicious string in the SNMP options of a
 Device, performing command injection and obtaining remote code execution on
 the underlying server. The `lib/snmp.php` file has a set of functions, with
 similar behavior, that accept in input some variables and place them into
 an `exec` call without a proper escape or validation. This issue has been
 addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
 known workarounds for this vulnerability.

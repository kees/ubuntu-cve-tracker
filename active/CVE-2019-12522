Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When Squid is run as root, it
 spawns its child processes as a lesser user, by default the user nobody.
 This is done via the leave_suid call. leave_suid leaves the Saved UID as 0.
 This makes it trivial for an attacker who has compromised the child process
 to escalate their privileges back to root.

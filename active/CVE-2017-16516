 https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/issues/176
 https://rubygems.org/gems/yajl-ruby
Description:
 In the yajl-ruby gem 1.3.0 for Ruby, when a crafted JSON file is supplied
 to Yajl::Parser.new.parse, the whole ruby process crashes with a SIGABRT in
 the yajl_string_decode function in yajl_encode.c. This results in the whole
 ruby process terminating and potentially a denial of service.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> issue in embedded copy of yajl, looks to affect upstream
   yajl, too
 rodrigo-zaiden> as of 2022-10-18, upstream yajl hasn't fixed it, only the
   embedded copy in ruby-yajl got fixed.
 rodrigo-zaiden> even though the code around this fix is similar between
   yajl and ruby-yajl, the risk of patching one based in the other could be
   risky without upstream support.

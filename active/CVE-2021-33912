 https://github.com/shevek/libspf2/commit/28faf4624a6a371b11afdb9820078d3b0ee3803d
Description:
 libspf2 before 1.2.11 has a four-byte heap-based buffer overflow that might
 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (via an unauthenticated
 e-mail message from anywhere on the Internet) with a crafted SPF DNS
 record, because of incorrect sprintf usage in SPF_record_expand_data in
 spf_expand.c. The vulnerable code may be part of the supply chain of a
 site's e-mail infrastructure (e.g., with additional configuration, Exim can
 use libspf2; the Postfix web site links to unofficial patches for use of
 libspf2 with Postfix; older versions of spfquery relied on libspf2) but
 most often is not.

Description:
 If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policy
 processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice recursively.
 On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this results in a denial
 of service when the affected process hangs. Policy processing being enabled
 on a publicly facing server is not considered to be a common setup. Policy
 processing is enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line
 utilities or by calling either `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy()' or
 `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' functions.

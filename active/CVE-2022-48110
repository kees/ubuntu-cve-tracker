Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** CKSource CKEditor 5 35.4.0 was discovered to contain a
 cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the Full Featured CKEditor5
 widget. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this is not a vulnerability.
 The CKEditor 5 documentation discusses that it is the responsibility of an
 integrator (who is adding CKEditor 5 functionality to a website) to choose
 the correct security settings for their use case. Also, safe default values
 are established (e.g., config.htmlEmbed.showPreviews is false).

Description:
 An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.8. When g_file_replace()
 is used with G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION to replace a path that is a
 dangling symlink, it incorrectly also creates the target of the symlink as
 an empty file, which could conceivably have security relevance if the
 symlink is attacker-controlled. (If the path is a symlink to a file that
 already exists, then the contents of that file correctly remain unchanged.)

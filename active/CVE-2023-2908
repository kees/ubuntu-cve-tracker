 https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/-/commit/9bd48f0dbd64fb94dc2b5b05238fde0bfdd4ff3f
Description:
 A null pointer dereference issue was discovered in Libtiff's tif_dir.c
 file. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a crafted TIFF image file to the
 tiffcp utility, which triggers runtime error, causing an undefined
 behavior, resulting in an application crash, eventually leading to a denial
 of service.

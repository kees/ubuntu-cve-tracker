Description:
 A denial of service vulnerability in the multipart parsing component of
 Rack fixed in 2.0.9.2, 2.1.4.2, 2.2.4.1 and 3.0.0.1 could allow an attacker
 tocraft input that can cause RFC2183 multipart boundary parsing in Rack to
 take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of
 service attack vector. Any applications that parse multipart posts using
 Rack (virtually all Rails applications) are impacted.

Description:
 crossbeam-deque is a package of work-stealing deques for building task
 schedulers when programming in Rust. In versions prior to 0.7.4 and 0.8.0,
 the result of the race condition is that one or more tasks in the worker
 queue can be popped twice instead of other tasks that are forgotten and
 never popped. If tasks are allocated on the heap, this can cause double
 free and a memory leak. If not, this still can cause a logical bug. Crates
 using `Stealer::steal`, `Stealer::steal_batch`, or
 `Stealer::steal_batch_and_pop` are affected by this issue. This has been
 fixed in crossbeam-deque 0.8.1 and 0.7.4.

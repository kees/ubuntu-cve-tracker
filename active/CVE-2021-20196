Description:
 A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the floppy disk emulator of
 QEMU. This issue occurs while processing read/write ioport commands if the
 selected floppy drive is not initialized with a block device. This flaw
 allows a privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host,
 resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to system availability.

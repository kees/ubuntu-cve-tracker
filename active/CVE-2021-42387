Description:
 Heap out-of-bounds read in Clickhouse's LZ4 compression codec when parsing
 a malicious query. As part of the LZ4::decompressImpl() loop, a 16-bit
 unsigned user-supplied value ('offset') is read from the compressed data.
 The offset is later used in the length of a copy operation, without
 checking the upper bounds of the source of the copy operation.

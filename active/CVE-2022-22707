Description:
 In lighttpd 1.4.46 through 1.4.63, the mod_extforward_Forwarded function of
 the mod_extforward plugin has a stack-based buffer overflow (4 bytes
 representing -1), as demonstrated by remote denial of service (daemon
 crash) in a non-default configuration. The non-default configuration
 requires handling of the Forwarded header in a somewhat unusual manner.
 Also, a 32-bit system is much more likely to be affected than a 64-bit
 system.

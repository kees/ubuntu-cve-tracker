Description:
 e2guardian v5.4.x <= v5.4.3r is affected by missing SSL certificate
 validation in the SSL MITM engine. In standalone mode (i.e., acting as a
 proxy or a transparent proxy), with SSL MITM enabled, e2guardian, if built
 with OpenSSL v1.1.x, did not validate hostnames in certificates of the web
 servers that it connected to, and thus was itself vulnerable to MITM
 attacks.

Description:
 This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on
 affected installations of MariaDB. Authentication is required to exploit
 this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of SQL
 queries. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length
 of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based
 buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges
 and execute arbitrary code in the context of the service account. Was
 ZDI-CAN-16190.

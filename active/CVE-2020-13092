Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** scikit-learn (aka sklearn) through 0.23.0 can unserialize
 and execute commands from an untrusted file that is passed to the
 joblib.load() function, if __reduce__ makes an os.system call. NOTE: third
 parties dispute this issue because the joblib.load() function is documented
 as unsafe and it is the user's responsibility to use the function in a
 secure manner.

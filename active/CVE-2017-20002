Description:
 The Debian shadow package before 4.5-1 for Shadow incorrectly lists pts/0
 and pts/1 as physical terminals in /etc/securetty. This allows local users
 to login as password-less users even if they are connected by non-physical
 means such as SSH (hence bypassing PAM's nullok_secure configuration). This
 notably affects environments such as virtual machines automatically
 generated with a default blank root password, allowing all local users to
 escalate privileges.

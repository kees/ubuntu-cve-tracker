Description:
 Crafted PNG grayscale images may lead to out-of-bounds write in heap.
 A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write in the
 heap area. An attacker may take advantage of that to cause heap data corruption
 or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent secure boot protections.
 This issue has a high complexity to be exploited as an attacker needs to
 perform some triage over the heap layout to achieve significant results, also
 the values written into the memory are repeated three times in a row making
 difficult to produce valid payloads.

Description:
 Xpdf prior to version 4.04 contains an integer overflow in the JBIG2
 decoder (JBIG2Stream::readTextRegionSeg() in JBIG2Stream.cc). Processing a
 specially crafted PDF file or JBIG2 image could lead to a crash or the
 execution of arbitrary code. This is similar to the vulnerability described
 by CVE-2021-30860 (Apple CoreGraphics).

 https://github.com/openNDS/openNDS/commit/69dde77927b252e2a4347170504a785ac5d50c33 (v10.1.3)
Description:
 An issue was discovered in the captive portal in OpenNDS before version
 10.1.3. get_query in http_microhttpd.c does not validate the length of the
 query string of GET requests. This leads to a stack-based buffer overflow
 in versions 9.x and earlier, and to a heap-based buffer overflow in
 versions 10.x and later. Attackers may exploit the issue to crash OpenNDS
 (Denial-of-Service condition) or to inject and execute arbitrary bytecode
 (Remote Code Execution).

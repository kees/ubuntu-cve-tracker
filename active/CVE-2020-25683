Description: 
 Dnsmasq version before 2.83 is susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow
 when DNSSEC is enabled. A remote attacker, who can create valid DNS
 replies, could use this flaw to cause an overflow in a heap-allocated
 memory. This flaw is caused by the lack of length checks in
 rtc1035.c:extract_name(), which could be abused to make the code execute
 memcpy() with a negative size in get_rdata() and cause a crash in Dnsmasq,
 resulting in a Denial of Service.

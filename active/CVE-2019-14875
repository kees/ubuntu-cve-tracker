Description:
 In the __multiply function of the newlib libc library, all versions prior
 to 3.3.0 (see newlib/libc/stdlib/mprec.c), Balloc is used to allocate a big
 integer, however no check is performed to verify if the allocation
 succeeded or not. The access of _x[0] will trigger a null pointer
 dereference bug in case of a memory allocation failure.

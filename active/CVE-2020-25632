Description:
 A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod
 implementation allows the unloading of a module used as a dependency
 without checking if any other dependent module is still loaded leading to a
 use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary code to be executed or
 a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system
 availability.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Chris Coulson discovered that the rmmod command in GRUB 2 contained a
 use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute
 arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.
Notes: 
 amurray| CVE title: "grub2: use-after-free in rmmod command"
 sbeattie| grub2-unsigned will contain fixes and supersede grub2, which
  will contain only BIOS grub bits.

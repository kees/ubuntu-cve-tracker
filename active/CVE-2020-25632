Description:
 A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod
 implementation allows the unloading of a module used as a dependency
 without checking if any other dependent module is still loaded leading to a
 use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary code to be executed or
 a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system
 availability.

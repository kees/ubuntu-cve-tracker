Description: 
 The rmmod implementation for grub2 is flawed, allowing an attacker to
 unload a module used as dependency without checking if any other dependent
 module is still loaded. This leads to an use-after-free scenario possibly
 allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code and by-pass Secure Boot
 protections.

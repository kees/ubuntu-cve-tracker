Description:
 libmemcached-awesome is an open source C/C++ client library and tools for
 the memcached server. `libmemcached` could return data for a previously
 requested key, if that previous request timed out due to a low
 `POLL_TIMEOUT`. This issue has been addressed in version 1.1.4. Users are
 advised to upgrade. There are several ways to workaround or lower the
 probability of this bug affecting a given deployment. 1: use a reasonably
 high `POLL_TIMEOUT` setting, like the default. 2: use separate libmemcached
 connections for unrelated data. 3: do not re-use libmemcached connections
 in an unknown state.

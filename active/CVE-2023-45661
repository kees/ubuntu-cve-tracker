Description:
 stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images. A
 crafted image file may trigger out of bounds memcpy read in
 `stbi__gif_load_next`. This happens because two_back points to a memory
 address lower than the start of the buffer out. This issue may be used to
 leak internal memory allocation information.

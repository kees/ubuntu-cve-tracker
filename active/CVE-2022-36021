Description:
 Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users
 can use string matching commands (like `SCAN` or `KEYS`) with a specially
 crafted pattern to trigger a denial-of-service attack on Redis, causing it
 to hang and consume 100% CPU time. The problem is fixed in Redis versions
 6.0.18, 6.2.11, 7.0.9.

Description:
 Loofah is a general library for manipulating and transforming HTML/XML
 documents and fragments, built on top of Nokogiri. Loofah >= 2.2.0, <
 2.19.1 uses recursion for sanitizing CDATA sections, making it susceptible
 to stack exhaustion and raising a SystemStackError exception. This may lead
 to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption. This issue is
 patched in version 2.19.1. Users who are unable to upgrade may be able to
 mitigate this vulnerability by limiting the length of the strings that are
 sanitized.

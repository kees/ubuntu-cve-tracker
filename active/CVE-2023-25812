Description:
 Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. Affected versions do not
 correctly honor a `Deny` policy on ByPassGoverance. Ideally, minio should
 return "Access Denied" to all users attempting to DELETE a versionId with
 the special header `X-Amz-Bypass-Governance-Retention: true`. However, this
 was not honored instead the request will be honored and an object under
 governance would be incorrectly deleted. All users are advised to upgrade.
 There are no known workarounds for this issue.

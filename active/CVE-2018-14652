Description:
 The Gluster file system through versions 3.12 and 4.1.4 is vulnerable to a
 buffer overflow in the 'features/index' translator via the code handling
 the 'GF_XATTR_CLRLK_CMD' xattr in the 'pl_getxattr' function. A remote
 authenticated attacker could exploit this on a mounted volume to cause a
 denial of service.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled certain files. A remote
 authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of
 service.

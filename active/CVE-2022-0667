Description: 
 While BIND is processing a request for a DS record that needs to be
 forwarded, it waits until this processing is complete or until the
 backstop lifetime timer has timed out. When the resume_dslookup() function
 is called as a result of such a timeout, the function does not test
 whether the fetch has previously been shut down. This introduces the
 possibility of triggering an assertion failure, which could cause the BIND
 process to terminate.

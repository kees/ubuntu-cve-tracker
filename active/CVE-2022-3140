Description:
 LibreOffice supports Office URI Schemes to enable browser integration of
 LibreOffice with MS SharePoint server. An additional scheme
 'vnd.libreoffice.command' specific to LibreOffice was added. In the
 affected versions of LibreOffice links using that scheme could be
 constructed to call internal macros with arbitrary arguments. Which when
 clicked on, or activated by document events, could result in arbitrary
 script execution without warning. This issue affects: The Document
 Foundation LibreOffice 7.4 versions prior to 7.4.1; 7.3 versions prior to
 7.3.6.

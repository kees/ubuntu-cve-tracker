Description:
 A flaw was found in RPM's signature check functionality when reading a
 package file. This flaw allows an attacker who can convince a victim to
 install a seemingly verifiable package, whose signature header was
 modified, to cause RPM database corruption and execute code. The highest
 threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity, confidentiality, and
 system availability.

Description:
 [libcurl provides the `CURLOPT_CERTINFO` option to allow applications to
 request details to be returned about a TLS server's certificate chain.

 Due to an erroneous function, a malicious server could make libcurl built
 with NSS get stuck in a never-ending busy-loop when trying to retrieve that
 information.]

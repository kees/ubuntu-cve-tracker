Description:
 FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on
 standard Python type hints. When using form data, `python-multipart` uses a
 Regular Expression to parse the HTTP `Content-Type` header, including
 options. An attacker could send a custom-made `Content-Type` option that is
 very difficult for the RegEx to process, consuming CPU resources and
 stalling indefinitely (minutes or more) while holding the main event loop.
 This means that process can't handle any more requests. It's a
 ReDoS(Regular expression Denial of Service), it only applies to those
 reading form data, using `python-multipart`. This vulnerability has been
 patched in version 0.109.1.

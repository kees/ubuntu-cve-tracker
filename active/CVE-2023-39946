 https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/commit/7c1c611f2f70ec238fbde30a9ed044d99191e4fb (v2.11.1)
Description:
 eprosima Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution Service
 standard of the Object Management Group. Prior to versions 2.11.1, 2.10.2,
 2.9.2, and 2.6.6, heap can be overflowed by providing a PID_PROPERTY_LIST
 parameter that contains a CDR string with length larger than the size of
 actual content. In
 `eprosima::fastdds::dds::ParameterPropertyList_t::push_back_helper`,
 `memcpy` is called to first copy the octet'ized length and then to copy the
 data into `properties_.data`. At the second memcpy, both `data` and `size`
 can be controlled by anyone that sends the CDR string to the discovery
 multicast port. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process. Versions
 2.11.1, 2.10.2, 2.9.2, and 2.6.6 contain a patch for this issue.

 https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/neutron/+/776599
Description:
 A flaw was found in openstack-neutron's default Open vSwitch firewall
 rules. By sending carefully crafted packets, anyone in control of a server
 instance connected to the virtual switch can impersonate the IPv6 addresses
 of other systems on the network, resulting in denial of service or in some
 cases possibly interception of traffic intended for other destinations.
 Only deployments using the Open vSwitch driver are affected. Source:
 OpenStack project. Versions before openstack-neutron 15.3.3,
 openstack-neutron 16.3.1 and openstack-neutron 17.1.1 are affected.

Description:
 An authentication flaw was found in ceph in versions before 14.2.20. When
 the monitor handles CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY requests, it doesn't
 sanitize other_keys, allowing key reuse. An attacker who can request a
 global_id can exploit the ability of any user to request a global_id
 previously associated with another user, as ceph does not force the reuse
 of old keys to generate new ones. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system
 availability.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Ceph contained an authentication flaw, leading
 to key reuse. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
 or possibly impersonate another user.
Notes:
 mdeslaur> this is fixed in 15.2.11 in focal-updates and groovy-updates,
 mdeslaur> and 16.2.1 in hirsute-updates but has not been pushed to the
 mdeslaur> security pocket

Description:
 LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros within
 documents, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the document
 occurred since the last signing and that the signature is valid. An
 Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an
 attacker to modify a digitally signed ODF document to insert an additional
 signing time timestamp which LibreOffice would incorrectly present as a
 valid signature signed at the bogus signing time. This issue affects: The
 Document Foundation LibreOffice 7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6; 7-1 versions
 prior to 7.1.2.

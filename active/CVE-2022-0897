Description:
 A flaw was found in the libvirt nwfilter driver. The
 virNWFilterObjListNumOfNWFilters method failed to acquire the
 `driver->nwfilters` mutex before iterating over virNWFilterObj instances.
 There was no protection to stop another thread from concurrently modifying
 the `driver->nwfilters` object. This flaw allows a malicious, unprivileged
 user to exploit this issue via libvirtâ€™s API virConnectNumOfNWFilters to
 crash the network filter management daemon (libvirtd/virtnwfilterd).

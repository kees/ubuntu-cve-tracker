Description:
 PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2
 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature
 vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1
 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does
 not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default
 CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the
 signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type
 of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured
 explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification
 process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.

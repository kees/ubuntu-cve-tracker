Description:
 PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard.
 PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic
 signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default
 CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are
 impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly
 signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1
 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default
 xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1
 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for
 the verification process of the SAML document signature.
 
 
 This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.

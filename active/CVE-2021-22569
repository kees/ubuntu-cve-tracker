Description:
 An issue in protobuf-java allowed the interleaving of
 com.google.protobuf.UnknownFieldSet fields in such a way that would be
 processed out of order. A small malicious payload can occupy the parser for
 several minutes by creating large numbers of short-lived objects that cause
 frequent, repeated pauses. We recommend upgrading libraries beyond the
 vulnerable versions.

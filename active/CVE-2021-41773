Description:
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP
 Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to
 files outside the expected document root. If files outside of the document
 root are not protected by "require all denied" these requests can succeed.
 Additionally this flaw could leak the source of interpreted files like CGI
 scripts. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only
 affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions.

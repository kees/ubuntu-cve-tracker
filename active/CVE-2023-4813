Description:
 A flaw was found in glibc. In an uncommon situation, the gaih_inet function
 may use memory that has been freed, resulting in an application crash. This
 issue is only exploitable when the getaddrinfo function is called and the
 hosts database in /etc/nsswitch.conf is configured with SUCCESS=continue or
 SUCCESS=merge.

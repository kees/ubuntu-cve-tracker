Description:
 LZ4 before 1.9.2 has a heap-based buffer overflow in LZ4_write32 (related
 to LZ4_compress_destSize), affecting applications that call
 LZ4_compress_fast with a large input. (This issue can also lead to data
 corruption.) NOTE: the vendor states "only a few specific / uncommon usages
 of the API are at risk."

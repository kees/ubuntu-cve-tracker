Description:
 Bluetooth Classic in Bluetooth Core Specification through 5.3 does not
 properly conceal device information for Bluetooth transceivers in
 Non-Discoverable mode. By conducting an efficient over-the-air attack, an
 attacker can fully extract the permanent, unique Bluetooth MAC identifier,
 along with device capabilities and identifiers, some of which may contain
 identifying information about the device owner. This additionally allows
 the attacker to establish a connection to the target device.

 alexmurray> Since this vulnerability affects the Bluetooth Core
  Specification it may then also affect bluez on Ubuntu. At this stage there
  is little detail publicly available about this vulnerability though and no

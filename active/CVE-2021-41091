Description: 
 A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where the data directory
 (typically /var/lib/docker) contained subdirectories with
 insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged
 Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When
 containers included executable programs with extended permission bits
 (such as setuid), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute
 those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host
 collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the
 unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify
 those files.

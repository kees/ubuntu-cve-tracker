Description:
 The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive
 computing. Prior to version 6.4.9, unauthorized actors can access sensitive
 information from server logs. Anytime a 5xx error is triggered, the auth
 cookie and other header values are recorded in Jupyter server logs by
 default. Considering these logs do not require root access, an attacker can
 monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie information, and gain
 access to the Jupyter server. Jupyter notebook version 6.4.x contains a
 patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.

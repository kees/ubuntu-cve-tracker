Description:
 Integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets; A malicious crafted IP
 packet can lead to an integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets()
 function on rsm->total_len value. Under certain circumstances the
 total_len value may end up wrapping around to a small integer number which
 will be used in memory allocation. If the attack succeeds in such way,
 subsequent operations can write past the end of the buffer.

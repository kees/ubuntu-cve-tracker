Description:
 In Gradle before version 7.0, on Unix-like systems, the system temporary
 directory can be created with open permissions that allow multiple users to
 create and delete files within it. Gradle builds could be vulnerable to a
 local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating
 files in the system temporary directory. This vulnerability impacted builds
 using precompiled script plugins written in Kotlin DSL and tests for Gradle
 plugins written using ProjectBuilder or TestKit. If you are on Windows or
 modern versions of macOS, you are not vulnerable. If you are on a Unix-like
 operating system with the "sticky" bit set on your system temporary
 directory, you are not vulnerable. The problem has been patched and
 released with Gradle 7.0. As a workaround, on Unix-like operating systems,
 ensure that the "sticky" bit is set. This only allows the original user (or
 root) to delete a file. If you are unable to change the permissions of the
 system temporary directory, you can move the Java temporary directory by
 setting the System Property `java.io.tmpdir`. The new path needs to limit
 permissions to the build user only. For additional details refer to the
 referenced GitHub Security Advisory.

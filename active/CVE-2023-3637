Description:
 An uncontrolled resource consumption flaw was found in openstack-neutron.
 This flaw allows a remote authenticated user to query a list of security
 groups for an invalid project. This issue creates resources that are
 unconstrained by the user's quota. If a malicious user were to submit a
 significant number of requests, this could lead to a denial of service.

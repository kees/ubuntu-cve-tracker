Description:
 There is an invalid memory access in the TextLine class in TextOutputDev.cc
 in Xpdf 4.0.4 because the text extractor mishandles characters at large y
 coordinates. It can be triggered by (for example) sending a crafted pdf
 file to the pdftotext binary, which allows a remote attacker to cause a
 Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact.

Description:
 SABnzbd is an open source binary newsreader. A vulnerability was discovered
 in SABnzbd that could trick the `filesystem.renamer()` function into
 writing downloaded files outside the configured Download Folder via
 malicious PAR2 files. A patch was released as part of SABnzbd 3.2.1RC1. As
 a workaround, limit downloads to NZBs without PAR2 files, deny write
 permissions to the SABnzbd process outside areas it must access to perform
 its job, or update to a fixed version.

Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 alexmurray> As documented by Intel, this microcode update must be applied
  along with a corresponding BIOS update, otherwise affected systems with
  SGX enabled may hang at boot. As such in Ubuntu we are excluding these
  affected microcode updates from the planned update of the intel-microcode
  package to ensure systems are not rendered unbootable (as there is no way
  to coordinate the installation of the BIOS update with this microcode
  update from Ubuntu)

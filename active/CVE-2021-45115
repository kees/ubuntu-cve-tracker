Description:
 An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.26, 3.2 before 3.2.11, and
 4.0 before 4.0.1. UserAttributeSimilarityValidator incurred significant
 overhead in evaluating a submitted password that was artificially large in
 relation to the comparison values. In a situation where access to user
 registration was unrestricted, this provided a potential vector for a
 denial-of-service attack.

Description:
 LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g.
 users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions
 prior to 8.0 There are cases where LAM instantiates objects from arbitrary
 classes. An attacker can inject the first constructor argument. This can
 lead to code execution if non-LAM classes are instantiated that execute
 code during object creation. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0.

Description:
 Drupal 8.4.x versions before 8.4.5 and Drupal 7.x versions before 7.57 has
 a Drupal.checkPlain() JavaScript function which is used to escape
 potentially dangerous text before outputting it to HTML (as JavaScript
 output does not typically go through Twig autoescaping). This function does
 not correctly handle all methods of injecting malicious HTML, leading to a
 cross-site scripting vulnerability under certain circumstances. The PHP
 functions which Drupal provides for HTML escaping are not affected.

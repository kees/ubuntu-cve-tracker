Description:
 Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of
 reusable PHP components. Starting in versions 5.4.21 and 6.2.7 and prior to
 versions 5.4.31 and 6.3.8, `SessionStrategyListener` does not migrate the
 session after every successful login. It does so only in case the logged in
 user changes by means of checking the user identifier. In some use cases,
 the user identifier doesn't change between the verification phase and the
 successful login, while the token itself changes from one type
 (partially-authenticated) to another (fully-authenticated). When this
 happens, the session id should be regenerated to prevent possible session
 fixations, which is not the case at the moment. As of versions 5.4.31 and
 6.3.8, Symfony now checks the type of the token in addition to the user
 identifier before deciding whether the session id should be regenerated.

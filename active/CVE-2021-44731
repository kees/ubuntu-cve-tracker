Description:
 A race condition in snap-confine exists when preparing a private mount
 namespace for a snap. This could allow a local attacker to gain root
 privileges by bind-mounting their own contents inside the snap's private
 mount namespace and causing snap-confine to execute arbitrary code and
 hence privilege escalation.

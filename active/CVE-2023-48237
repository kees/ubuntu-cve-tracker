Description:
 Vim is an open source command line text editor. In affected versions when
 shifting lines in operator pending mode and using a very large value, it
 may be possible to overflow the size of integer. Impact is low, user
 interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations.
 This issue has been addressed in commit `6bf131888` which has been included
 in version 9.0.2112. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.

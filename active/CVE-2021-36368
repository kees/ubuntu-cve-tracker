Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client
 is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without
 -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to
 support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine
 whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to
 connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to
 connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's
 position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being
 bypassed."
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
  cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
  support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.
 mdeslaur> This CVE appears to have been disputed by upstream, but there
 mdeslaur> doesn't appear to be a public statement about it. Marking as
 mdeslaur> deferred for now in case more information becomes available.

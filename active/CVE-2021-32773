Description:
 Racket is a general-purpose programming language and an ecosystem for
 language-oriented programming. In versions prior to 8.2, code evaluated
 using the Racket sandbox could cause system modules to incorrectly use
 attacker-created modules instead of their intended dependencies. This could
 allow system functions to be controlled by the attacker, giving access to
 facilities intended to be restricted. This problem is fixed in Racket
 version 8.2. A workaround is available, depending on system settings. For
 systems that provide arbitrary Racket evaluation, external sandboxing such
 as containers limit the impact of the problem. For multi-user evaluation
 systems, such as the `handin-server` system, it is not possible to work
 around this problem and upgrading is required.

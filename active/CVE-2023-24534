Description:
 HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory, even
 when parsing small inputs, potentially leading to a denial of service.
 Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common function used
 to parse HTTP and MIME headers to allocate substantially more memory than
 required to hold the parsed headers. An attacker can exploit this behavior
 to cause an HTTP server to allocate large amounts of memory from a small
 request, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service.
 With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required
 to hold parsed headers.

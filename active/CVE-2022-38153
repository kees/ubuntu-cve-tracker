Description:
 An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0 (when
 --enable-session-ticket is used); however, only version 5.3.0 is
 exploitable. Man-in-the-middle attackers or a malicious server can crash
 TLS 1.2 clients during a handshake. If an attacker injects a large ticket
 (more than 256 bytes) into a NewSessionTicket message in a TLS 1.2
 handshake, and the client has a non-empty session cache, the session cache
 frees a pointer that points to unallocated memory, causing the client to
 crash with a "free(): invalid pointer" message. NOTE: It is likely that
 this is also exploitable during TLS 1.3 handshakes between a client and a
 malicious server. With TLS 1.3, it is not possible to exploit this as a
 man-in-the-middle.

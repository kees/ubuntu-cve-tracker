Description:
 A heap buffer overflow was found in the floppy disk emulator of QEMU up to
 6.0.0 (including). It could occur in fdctrl_transfer_handler() in
 hw/block/fdc.c while processing DMA read data transfers from the floppy
 drive to the guest system. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to
 crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario, or potential
 information leakage from the host memory.

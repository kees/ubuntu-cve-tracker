Description:
 Improper input validation of octal strings in Python stdlib ipaddress 3.10
 and below allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform indeterminate
 SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks on many programs that rely on Python stdlib
 ipaddress. IP address octects are left stripped instead of evaluated as
 valid IP addresses.

Description:
 LibTIFF master branch has an out-of-bounds read in LZWDecode in
 libtiff/tif_lzw.c:619, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via
 a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix
 is available with commit b4e79bfa.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> according to the issue in the libtiff git (410), this only affects
 ccdm94> version 4.3.0 onwards. Further investigation has confirmed that
 ccdm94> versions below 4.3.0 seem to be not-affected, as the reproducer
 ccdm94> does not work, and there are no SEGV errors. Impish and jammy,
 ccdm94> which include version 4.3.0, also do not seem to be affected, as
 ccdm94> results from running the POCs with their versions are different
 ccdm94> than the ones obtained when the specific commit mentioned in the
 ccdm94> 410 issue is used with the same POC files. Therefore, it is very
 ccdm94> likely that the vulnerable code was introduced in between jammy's
 ccdm94> version of the package and commit b51bb157. Jammy and earlier will
 ccdm94> be marked as not vulnerable.

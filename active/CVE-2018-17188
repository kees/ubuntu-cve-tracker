Description:
 Prior to CouchDB version 2.3.0, CouchDB allowed for runtime-configuration
 of key components of the database. In some cases, this lead to
 vulnerabilities where CouchDB admin users could access the underlying
 operating system as the CouchDB user. Together with other vulnerabilities,
 it allowed full system entry for unauthenticated users. Rather than waiting
 for new vulnerabilities to be discovered, and fixing them as they come up,
 the CouchDB development team decided to make changes to avoid this entire
 class of vulnerabilities.

Description:
 A number of race conditions have been identified within the
 slurmd/slurmstepd processes that can lead to the user taking ownership
 of an arbitrary file on the system. A related issue can lead to the
 user overwriting an arbitrary file on the compute node (although with
 data that is not directly under their control). A related issue can
 also lead to the user deleting all files and sub-directories of an
 arbitrary target directory on the compute node.

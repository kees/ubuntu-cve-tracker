Description:
 A flaw was found in the tracker-miners package. A weakness in the sandbox
 allows a maliciously-crafted file to execute code outside the sandbox if
 the tracker-extract process has first been compromised by a separate
 vulnerability.

Notes:
 sbeattie> seccomp sandbox escape, requires an additional vulnerability
   to take advantage of it
 mdeslaur> Incomplete fix in 3.3.2, better fix in 3.3.3
 mdeslaur> Incomplete fix in 3.4.5, better fix in 3.4.6
 mdeslaur> Sandbox confinement in focal and earlier is considerably
 mdeslaur> different, we will not be backporting this fix to focal and
 mdeslaur> earlier since this is simply a hardening measure, and does not
 mdeslaur> represent an actual vulnerability.

Description:
 Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception
 may occur when calculating the line offset for overlong lines and smooth
 scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag. This may
 happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues
 on the next physical line directly in the window border because the 'cpo'
 setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-default settings are
 affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has
 been addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release
 version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this vulnerability.

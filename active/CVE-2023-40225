Description:
 HAProxy through 2.0.32, 2.1.x and 2.2.x through 2.2.30, 2.3.x and 2.4.x
 through 2.4.23, 2.5.x and 2.6.x before 2.6.15, 2.7.x before 2.7.10, and
 2.8.x before 2.8.2 forwards empty Content-Length headers, violating RFC
 9110 section 8.6. In uncommon cases, an HTTP/1 server behind HAProxy may
 interpret the payload as an extra request.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> Content-Length headers parses where added in v1.9.0, hence
  versions prior to that are not affected.
Mitigation:
 frontend can reject requests with empty content-length header with the
 following rule
  http-request deny if { hdr_len(content-length) 0 }

Description:
 An authenticated user can create a link with reflected XSS payload for
 actions’ pages, and send it to other users. Malicious code has access to
 all the same objects as the rest of the web page and can make arbitrary
 modifications to the contents of the page being displayed to a victim. This
 attack can be implemented with the help of social engineering and
 expiration of a number of factors - an attacker should have authorized
 access to the Zabbix Frontend and allowed network connection between a
 malicious server and victim’s computer, understand attacked infrastructure,
 be recognized by the victim as a trustee and use trusted communication
 channel.

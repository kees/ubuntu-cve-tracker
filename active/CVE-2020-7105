 https://github.com/redis/hiredis/issues/747
Description:
 async.c and dict.c in libhiredis.a in hiredis through 0.14.0 allow a NULL
 pointer dereference because malloc return values are unchecked.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Hiredis did not properly catch unsuccessful attempts to
 allocate memory, resulting in null pointer dereferences. An attacker could
 potentially use this to cause Hiredis to crash.

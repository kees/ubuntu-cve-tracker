Description:
 Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more.
 Due to a NULL pointer dereference bug Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of
 Service attack against Squid's Gopher gateway. The gopher protocol is
 always available and enabled in Squid prior to Squid 6.0.1. Responses
 triggering this bug are possible to be received from any gopher server,
 even those without malicious intent. Gopher support has been removed in
 Squid version 6.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
 should reject all gopher URL requests.

Description:
 The client side in OpenSSH 5.7 through 8.4 has an Observable Discrepancy
 leading to an information leak in the algorithm negotiation. This allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to target initial connection attempts (where no
 host key for the server has been cached by the client). NOTE: some reports
 state that 8.5 and 8.6 are also affected.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
  cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
  support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.
 mdeslaur> Per the advisory, "The developers of OpenSSH are not planning to
 mdeslaur> change the behavior of OpenSSH regarding this issue"
 mdeslaur> We will not be releasing updates for Ubuntu for this issue.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> On 2020-12-02, it was announced that a partial mitigation has
 mdeslaur> been commited by OpenSSH developers:
 mdeslaur> https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/12/02/1
 sbeattie> partial mitigation landed in openssh 8.4p1
 litios> OpenSSH cannot be patch to fully mitigate this CVE as patching it
 litios> would disable the reordering of host key algorithms, breaking
 litios> RFC 4253. The partial mitigation disables this reordering
 litios> only in a single specific situation. Marking as deferred.
 ccdm94> patching this issue in trusty and xenial has been considered
 ccdm94> risky. Therefore, these releases will be marked as ignored.

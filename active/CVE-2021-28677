Description:
 An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For EPS data, the readline
 implementation used in EPSImageFile has to deal with any combination of \r
 and \n as line endings. It used an accidentally quadratic method of
 accumulating lines while looking for a line ending. A malicious EPS file
 could use this to perform a DoS of Pillow in the open phase, before an
 image was accepted for opening.

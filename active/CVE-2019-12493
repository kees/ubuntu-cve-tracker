Description:
 A stack-based buffer over-read exists in PostScriptFunction::transform in
 Function.cc in Xpdf 4.01.01 because GfxSeparationColorSpace and
 GfxDeviceNColorSpace mishandle tint transform functions. It can, for
 example, be triggered by sending a crafted PDF document to the pdftops
 tool. It might allow an attacker to cause Denial of Service or leak memory
 data.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> xpdf in koffice is 2.0
 mdeslaur> as of 2022-01-05, xpdf commit not available.
 ebarretto> Marking emscripten ignored as poppler code is only for test/example.
 ebarretto> since 0.5.12-1 libextractor does not use xpdf anymore.
 ebarretto> xpdf in Debian uses poppler, which is not affected or fixed

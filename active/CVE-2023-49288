Description:
 Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more.
 Affected versions of squid are subject to a a Use-After-Free bug which can
 lead to a Denial of Service attack via collapsed forwarding. All versions
 of Squid from 3.5 up to and including 5.9 configured with
 "collapsed_forwarding on" are vulnerable. Configurations with
 "collapsed_forwarding off" or without a "collapsed_forwarding" directive
 are not vulnerable. This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.0.1. Users are
 advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should remove all
 collapsed_forwarding lines from their squid.conf.

Description:
 PuTTY before 0.75 on Windows allows remote servers to cause a denial of
 service (Windows GUI hang) by telling the PuTTY window to change its title
 repeatedly at high speed, which results in many SetWindowTextA or
 SetWindowTextW calls. NOTE: the same attack methodology may affect some
 OS-level GUIs on Linux or other platforms for similar reasons.

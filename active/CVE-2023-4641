Description:
 A flaw was found in shadow-utils. When asking for a new password,
 shadow-utils asks the password twice. If the password fails on the second
 attempt, shadow-utils fails in cleaning the buffer used to store the first
 entry. This may allow an attacker with enough access to retrieve the
 password from the memory.

Description:
 In SaltStack Salt 2016.9 through 3002.6, a command injection vulnerability
 exists in the snapper module that allows for local privilege escalation on
 a minion. The attack requires that a file is created with a pathname that
 is backed up by snapper, and that the master calls the snapper.diff
 function (which executes popen unsafely).

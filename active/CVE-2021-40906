Description:
 CheckMK Raw Edition software (versions 1.5.0 to 1.6.0) does not sanitise
 the input of a web service parameter that is in an unauthenticated zone.
 This Reflected XSS allows an attacker to open a backdoor on the device with
 HTML content and interpreted by the browser (such as JavaScript or other
 client-side scripts) or to steal the session cookies of a user who has
 previously authenticated via a man in the middle. Successful exploitation
 requires access to the web service resource without authentication.

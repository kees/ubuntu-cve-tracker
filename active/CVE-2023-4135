Description:
 A heap out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in the virtual nvme device
 in QEMU. The QEMU process does not validate an offset provided by the guest
 before computing a host heap pointer, which is used for copying data back
 to the guest. Arbitrary heap memory relative to an allocated buffer can be
 disclosed.

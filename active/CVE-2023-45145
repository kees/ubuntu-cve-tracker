Description:
 Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. On startup, Redis
 begins listening on a Unix socket before adjusting its permissions to the
 user-provided configuration. If a permissive umask(2) is used, this creates
 a race condition that enables, during a short period of time, another
 process to establish an otherwise unauthorized connection. This problem has
 existed since Redis 2.6.0-RC1. This issue has been addressed in Redis
 versions 7.2.2, 7.0.14 and 6.2.14. Users are advised to upgrade. For users
 unable to upgrade, it is possible to work around the problem by disabling
 Unix sockets, starting Redis with a restrictive umask, or storing the Unix
 socket file in a protected directory.

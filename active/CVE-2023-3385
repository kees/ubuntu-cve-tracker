Description:
 An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from
 8.10 before 16.0.8, all versions starting from 16.1 before 16.1.3, all
 versions starting from 16.2 before 16.2.2. Under specific circumstances, a
 user importing a project 'from export' could access and read unrelated
 files via uploading a specially crafted file. This was due to a bug in
 `tar`, fixed in
 [`tar-1.35`](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2023-07/msg00005.html).

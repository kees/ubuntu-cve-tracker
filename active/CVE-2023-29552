Description:
 The Service Location Protocol (SLP, RFC 2608) allows an unauthenticated,
 remote attacker to register arbitrary services. This could allow the
 attacker to use spoofed UDP traffic to conduct a denial-of-service attack
 with a significant amplification factor.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> The SLP protocol was never meant to be made available to the
   public Internet, as the RFC 2165 authors recognize: "Service Location
   provides a dynamic configuration mechanism for applications in
   local area networks. It is not a global resolution system for the
   entire Internet; rather it is intended to serve enterprise networks
   with shared services."

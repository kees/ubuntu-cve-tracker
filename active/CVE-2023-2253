Description:
 A flaw was found in the `/v2/_catalog` endpoint in
 distribution/distribution, which accepts a parameter to control the maximum
 number of records returned (query string: `n`). This vulnerability allows a
 malicious user to submit an unreasonably large value for `n,` causing the
 allocation of a massive string array, possibly causing a denial of service
 through excessive use of memory.

Description:
 client_golang is the instrumentation library for Go applications in
 Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling
 around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1,
 HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded
 cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with
 non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented
 software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except
 `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before
 middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not
 have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown
 `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue.
 Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label
 name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected
 promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that
 will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a
 reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a
 limited set of methods.

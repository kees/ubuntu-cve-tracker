Description:
 A parsing issue similar to CVE-2022-3171, but with Message-Type Extensions
 in protobuf-java core and lite versions prior to 3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6 and
 3.16.3 can lead to a denial of service attack. Inputs containing multiple
 instances of non-repeated embedded messages with repeated or unknown fields
 causes objects to be converted back-n-forth between mutable and immutable
 forms, resulting in potentially long garbage collection pauses. We
 recommend updating to the versions mentioned above.

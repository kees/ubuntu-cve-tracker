Description:
 Some mod_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through
 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack. Configurations are affected
 when mod_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or
 ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the
 user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the
 proxied request-target using variable substitution. For example, something
 like: RewriteEngine on RewriteRule "^/here/(.*)"
 "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P] ProxyPassReverse /here/
 http://example.com:8080/ Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass
 of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to
 existing origin servers, and cache poisoning. Users are recommended to
 update to at least version 2.4.56 of Apache HTTP Server.

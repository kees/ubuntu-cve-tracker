Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 C. A buffer overflow vulnerability in versions 2.13 and prior affects
 applications that use PJSIP DNS resolver. It doesn't affect PJSIP users who
 do not utilise PJSIP DNS resolver. This vulnerability is related to
 CVE-2022-24793. The difference is that this issue is in parsing the query
 record `parse_query()`, while the issue in CVE-2022-24793 is in
 `parse_rr()`. A patch is available as commit `d1c5e4d` in the `master`
 branch. A workaround is to disable DNS resolution in PJSIP config (by
 setting `nameserver_count` to zero) or use an external resolver
 implementation instead.

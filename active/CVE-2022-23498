Description:
 Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. When
 datasource query caching is enabled, Grafana caches all headers, including
 `grafana_session`. As a result, any user that queries a datasource where
 the caching is enabled can acquire another userâ€™s session. To mitigate the
 vulnerability you can disable datasource query caching for all datasources.
 This issue has been patched in versions 9.2.10 and 9.3.4.

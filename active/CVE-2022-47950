Description:
 An issue was discovered in OpenStack Swift before 2.28.1, 2.29.x before
 2.29.2, and 2.30.0. By supplying crafted XML files, an authenticated user
 may coerce the S3 API into returning arbitrary file contents from the host
 server, resulting in unauthorized read access to potentially sensitive
 data. This impacts both s3api deployments (Rocky or later), and swift3
 deployments (Queens and earlier, no longer actively developed).

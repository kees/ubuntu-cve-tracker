Description:
 In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a memory malloc failure in tif_jbig.c. A crafted
 TIFF document can lead to an abort resulting in a remote denial of service
 attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> reported in libtiff, but issue lies in jbigkit
 mdeslaur> as of 2018-03-22, no fix available
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> this is a DoS only and is caused by the fact that jbigkit
 mdeslaur> handles failed memory allocations with abort(). (See
 mdeslaur> checked_malloc()). Fixing this properly would likely require
 mdeslaur> changing the library ABI.
 ccdm94> commit bc3293299b was released in 2020, and it seems to be the
 ccdm94> commit that fixes this issue, according to the commit message
 ccdm94> and according to tests made with the commit applied  to jbigkit
 ccdm94> (the error no longer occurs once this fix is applied).

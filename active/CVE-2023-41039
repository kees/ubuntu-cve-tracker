Description:
 RestrictedPython is a restricted execution environment for Python to run
 untrusted code. Python's "format" functionality allows someone controlling
 the format string to "read" all objects accessible through recursive
 attribute lookup and subscription from objects he can access. This can lead
 to critical information disclosure. With `RestrictedPython`, the format
 functionality is available via the `format` and `format_map` methods of
 `str` (and `unicode`) (accessed either via the class or its instances) and
 via `string.Formatter`. All known versions of `RestrictedPython` are
 vulnerable. This issue has been addressed in commit `4134aedcff1` which has
 been included in the 5.4 and 6.2 releases. Users are advised to upgrade.
 There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

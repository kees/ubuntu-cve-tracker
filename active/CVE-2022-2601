Description:
 A buffer overflow was found in grub_font_construct_glyph(). A malicious
 crafted pf2 font can lead to an overflow when calculating the
 max_glyph_size value, allocating a smaller than needed buffer for the
 glyph, this further leads to a buffer overflow and a heap based
 out-of-bounds write. An attacker may use this vulnerability to circumvent
 the secure boot mechanism.

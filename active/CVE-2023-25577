Description:
 Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Prior to version
 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number
 of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, but
 each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If
 a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data`,
 `request.form`, `request.files`, or
 `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, it can cause unexpectedly high
 resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by
 sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The
 amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling
 legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of
 memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file
 handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can
 exhaust or kill all available workers. Version 2.2.3 contains a patch for
 this issue.

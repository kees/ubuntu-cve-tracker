Description: 
 Information leak via symlinks of existance of files or directories outside
 of the exported share.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> per upstream, fixing this required a whole rewrite of the VFS
 mdeslaur> layer and there is no reasonable way to fix this in versions
 mdeslaur> older than 4.15.x. Marking this CVE as ignored for older
 mdeslaur> releases.
Mitigation: 
 This issue can be mitigated by disabling SMB1, which is the default
 configuration in Samba 4.11 and above. In environments where SMB1 cannot
 be disabled, symlink support can be disabled with unix extensions = no.

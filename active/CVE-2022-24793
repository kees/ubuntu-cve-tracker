Description:
 PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
 C. A buffer overflow vulnerability in versions 2.12 and prior affects
 applications that uses PJSIP DNS resolution. It doesn't affect PJSIP users
 who utilize an external resolver. A patch is available in the `master`
 branch of the `pjsip/pjproject` GitHub repository. A workaround is to
 disable DNS resolution in PJSIP config (by setting `nameserver_count` to
 zero) or use an external resolver instead.

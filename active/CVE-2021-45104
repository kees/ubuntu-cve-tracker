Description:
 A piece of secret information is sent over the network in the clear if the administrator has configured weaker
 encryption protocols or if some of the HTCondor daemons are version 8.8 or earlier. An attacker could use this
 secret information to control the slot of another user, including running their own code as that user. An attacker
 could also impersonate a condor_negotiator and condor_startd, tricking the condor_schedd into sending them the jobs
 of any user.

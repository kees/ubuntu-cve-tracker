Description:
 Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Prior to versions
 6.2.7 and 7.0.0, an attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua
 script can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result with a crash of
 the redis-server process. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and
 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching
 the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to
 block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.

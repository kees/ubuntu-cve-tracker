Description:
 Firejail before 0.9.60 allows truncation (resizing to length 0) of the
 firejail binary on the host by running exploit code inside a firejail
 sandbox and having the sandbox terminated. To succeed, certain conditions
 need to be fulfilled: The jail (with the exploit code inside) needs to be
 started as root, and it also needs to be terminated as root from the host
 (either by stopping it ungracefully (e.g., SIGKILL), or by using the
 --shutdown control command). This is similar to CVE-2019-5736.

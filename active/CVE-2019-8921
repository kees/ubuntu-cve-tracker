Description:
 An issue was discovered in bluetoothd in BlueZ through 5.48. The
 vulnerability lies in the handling of a SVC_ATTR_REQ by the SDP
 implementation. By crafting a malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the
 server into returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resulting
 in leaking arbitrary heap data. The root cause can be found in the function
 service_attr_req of sdpd-request.c. The server does not check whether the
 CSTATE data is the same in consecutive requests, and instead simply trusts
 that it is the same.

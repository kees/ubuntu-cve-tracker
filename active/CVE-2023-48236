Description:
 Vim is an open source command line text editor. When using the z= command,
 the user may overflow the count with values larger
 than MAX_INT. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may
 not even happen in all situations. This vulnerability has been addressed in
 commit `73b2d379` which has been included in release version 9.0.2111.
 Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.

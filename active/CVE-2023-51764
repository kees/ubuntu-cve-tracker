Description:
 Postfix through 3.8.4 allows SMTP smuggling unless configured with
 smtpd_data_restrictions=reject_unauth_pipelining and
 smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords=chunking (or certain other options that exist
 in recent versions). Remote attackers can use a published exploitation
 technique to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address,
 allowing bypass of an SPF protection mechanism. This occurs because Postfix
 supports <LF>.<CR><LF> but some other popular e-mail servers do not. To
 prevent attack variants (by always disallowing <LF> without <CR>), a
 different solution is required: the smtpd_forbid_bare_newline=yes option
 with a Postfix minimum version of 3.5.23, 3.6.13, 3.7.9, 3.8.4, or 3.9.

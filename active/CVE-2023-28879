Description:
 In Artifex Ghostscript through 10.01.0, there is a buffer overflow leading
 to potential corruption of data internal to the PostScript interpreter, in
 base/sbcp.c. This affects BCPEncode, BCPDecode, TBCPEncode, and TBCPDecode.
 If the write buffer is filled to one byte less than full, and one then
 tries to write an escaped character, two bytes are written.

Description: 
 Itâ€™s an issue in the handling of vhost-user inflight type messages. A
 malicious vhost-user master can attach an unexpected number of fds as
 ancillary data to VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD / VHOST_USER_SET_INFLIGHT_FD
 messages that are not closed by the vhost-user slave. By sending such
 messages continuously, the vhost-user master could exhaust available fd in
 the vhost-user slave process and lead to a DoS.

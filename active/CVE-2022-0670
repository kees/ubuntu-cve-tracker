Description:
 A flaw was found in Openstack manilla owning a Ceph File system "share",
 which enables the owner to read/write any manilla share or entire file
 system. The vulnerability is due to a bug in the "volumes" plugin in Ceph
 Manager. This allows an attacker to compromise Confidentiality and
 Integrity of a file system. Fixed in RHCS 5.2 and Ceph 17.2.2.

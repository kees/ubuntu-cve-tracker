Description:
 grub_parser_split_cmdline expands variable names present in the supplied
 command line in to their corresponding variable contents and uses a 1kB
 stack buffer for temporary storage without sufficient bounds checking. If
 the function is called with a command line that references a variable with
 a sufficiently large payload, it is possible to overflow the stack buffer,
 corrupt the stack frame and control execution.  An attacker may use this to
 circumvent Secure Boot protections.

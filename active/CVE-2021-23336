 https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-UPSTREAM-PYTHONCPYTHON-1074933
Description:
 The package python/cpython from 0 and before 3.6.13, from 3.7.0 and before
 3.7.10, from 3.8.0 and before 3.8.8, from 3.9.0 and before 3.9.2 are
 vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urllib.parse.parse_qsl and
 urllib.parse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the
 attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can
 cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy
 (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in
 malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would
 usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not
 include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.

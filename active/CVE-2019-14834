Description:
 A flaw was found in the Dnsmasq application where a remote attacker can
 trigger a memory leak by sending specially crafted DHCP responses to the
 server. A successful attack is dependent on a specific configuration
 regarding the domain name set into the dnsmasq.conf file. Over time, the
 memory leak may cause the process to run out of memory and terminate,
 causing a denial of service.

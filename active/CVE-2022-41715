Description:
 Programs which compile regular expressions from untrusted sources may be
 vulnerable to memory exhaustion or denial of service. The parsed regexp
 representation is linear in the size of the input, but in some cases the
 constant factor can be as high as 40,000, making relatively small regexps
 consume much larger amounts of memory. After fix, each regexp being parsed
 is limited to a 256 MB memory footprint. Regular expressions whose
 representation would use more space than that are rejected. Normal use of
 regular expressions is unaffected.

Description:
 ReadyMedia (MiniDLNA) versions from 1.1.15 up to 1.3.2 is vulnerable to
 Buffer Overflow. The vulnerability is caused by incorrect validation logic
 when handling HTTP requests using chunked transport encoding. This results
 in other code later using attacker-controlled chunk values that exceed the
 length of the allocated buffer, resulting in out-of-bounds read/write.

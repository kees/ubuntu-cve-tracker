Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** compose.php in SquirrelMail 1.4.22 calls unserialize for the
 $attachments value, which originates from an HTTP POST request. NOTE: the
 vendor disputes this because these two conditions for PHP object injection
 are not satisfied: existence of a PHP magic method (such as __wakeup or
 __destruct), and any attack-relevant classes must be declared before
 unserialize is called (or must be autoloaded). .

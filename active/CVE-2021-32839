Description:
 sqlparse is a non-validating SQL parser module for Python. In sqlparse
 versions 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 there is a regular Expression Denial of Service in
 sqlparse vulnerability. The regular expression may cause exponential
 backtracking on strings containing many repetitions of '\r\n' in SQL
 comments. Only the formatting feature that removes comments from SQL
 statements is affected by this regular expression. As a workaround don't
 use the sqlformat.format function with keyword strip_comments=True or the
 --strip-comments command line flag when using the sqlformat command line
 tool. The issues has been fixed in sqlparse 0.4.2.

Description:
 Guzzle, an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` headers on requests
 are sensitive information. In affected versions when using our Curl
 handler, it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an
 `Authorization` header. On making a request which responds with a redirect
 to a URI with a different origin (change in host, scheme or port), if we
 choose to follow it, we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option before
 continuing, stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to the
 new request. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon
 as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should
 upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented
 in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of the
 curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not cover
 change in scheme or change in port. If you do not require or expect
 redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.
 Alternatively, one can specify to use the Guzzle steam handler backend,
 rather than curl.

Description:
 Tcpreplay v4.3.0 beta1 contains a heap-based buffer over-read. The
 get_next_packet() function in the send_packets.c file uses the memcpy()
 function unsafely to copy sequences from the source buffer pktdata to the
 destination (*prev_packet)->pktdata. This will result in a Denial of
 Service (DoS) and potentially Information Exposure when the application
 attempts to process a file.

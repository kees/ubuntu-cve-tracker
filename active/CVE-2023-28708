Description:
 When using the RemoteIpFilter with requests received from a reverse proxy
 via HTTP that include the X-Forwarded-Proto header set to https, session
 cookies created by Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.0.-M2, 10.1.0-M1 to
 10.1.5, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.71 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.85 did not include the secure
 attribute. This could result in the user agent transmitting the session
 cookie over an insecure channel.

Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting
 (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data
 stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by
 administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's
 browser at view-time. The script under `data_sources.php` displays the data
 source management information (e.g. data source path, polling configuration
 etc.) for different data visualizations of the _cacti_ app. CENSUS found
 that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious data-source path,
 can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user of the same (or broader)
 privileges. A user that possesses the 'General
 Administration>Sites/Devices/Data' permissions can configure the data
 source path in Cacti. This configuration occurs through
 `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`. The same page can be used for
 previewing the data source path. This issue has been addressed in version
 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should
 manually escape HTML output.

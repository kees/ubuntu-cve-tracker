Description:
 jQuery-UI is the official jQuery user interface library. Prior to version
 1.13.0, accepting the value of the `altField` option of the Datepicker
 widget from untrusted sources may execute untrusted code. The issue is
 fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0. Any string value passed to the `altField` option
 is now treated as a CSS selector. A workaround is to not accept the value
 of the `altField` option from untrusted sources.

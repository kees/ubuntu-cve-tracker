Description:
 A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in ImageMagick in
 versions prior to 7.0.11-14 in ReadTIFFImage() in coders/tiff.c. This issue
 is due to an incorrect setting of the pixel array size, which can lead to a
 crash and segmentation fault.

  turns out it also applies to IM6 versions from 6.9.10.88. As such Ubuntu

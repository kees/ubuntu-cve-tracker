Description:
 An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. There is
 a variable "dbentry->n_key_data" in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store
 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a "u4" variable to
 it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this vulnerability to
 affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database
 dump file contains trusted data.

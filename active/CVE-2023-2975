Description:
 Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes
 it to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as a
 consequence. Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm
 and want to authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be
 mislead by removing adding or reordering such empty entries as these are
 ignored by the OpenSSL implementation. We are currently unaware of any such
 applications. The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple
 associated data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty
 data the application has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or
 EVP_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the
 input buffer length. The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns
 success for such a call instead of performing the associated data
 authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated. As
 this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and we
 expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data
 entries this is qualified as Low severity issue.

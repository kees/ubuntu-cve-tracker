Description:
 libvips is a demand-driven, horizontally threaded image processing library.
 A specially crafted SVG input can cause libvips versions 8.14.3 or earlier
 to segfault when attempting to parse a malformed UTF-8 character. Users
 should upgrade to libvips version 8.14.4 (or later) when processing
 untrusted input.

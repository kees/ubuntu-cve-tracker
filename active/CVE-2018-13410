Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Info-ZIP Zip 3.0, when the -T and -TT command-line options
 are used, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free and
 application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact because of an
 off-by-one error. NOTE: it is unclear whether there are realistic scenarios
 in which an untrusted party controls the -TT value, given that the entire
 purpose of -TT is execution of arbitrary commands.

Description:
 An issue was discovered in the Multipart Request Parser in Django 3.2
 before 3.2.18, 4.0 before 4.0.10, and 4.1 before 4.1.7. Passing certain
 inputs (e.g., an excessive number of parts) to multipart forms could result
 in too many open files or memory exhaustion, and provided a potential
 vector for a denial-of-service attack.

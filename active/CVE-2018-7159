Description:
 The HTTP parser in all current versions of Node.js ignores spaces in the
 `Content-Length` header, allowing input such as `Content-Length: 1 2` to be
 interpreted as having a value of `12`. The HTTP specification does not
 allow for spaces in the `Content-Length` value and the Node.js HTTP parser
 has been brought into line on this particular difference. The security risk
 of this flaw to Node.js users is considered to be VERY LOW as it is
 difficult, and may be impossible, to craft an attack that makes use of this
 flaw in a way that could not already be achieved by supplying an incorrect
 value for `Content-Length`. Vulnerabilities may exist in user-code that
 make incorrect assumptions about the potential accuracy of this value
 compared to the actual length of the data supplied. Node.js users crafting
 lower-level HTTP utilities are advised to re-check the length of any input
 supplied after parsing is complete.

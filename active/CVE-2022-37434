 https://github.com/ivd38/zlib_overflow
Description:
 zlib through 1.2.12 has a heap-based buffer over-read or buffer overflow in
 inflate in inflate.c via a large gzip header extra field. NOTE: only
 applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some common
 applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call
 inflateGetHeader (e.g., see the nodejs/node reference).
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Since 3.1.3-7, rsync builds with the system zlib.
 mdeslaur> Apps are only vulnerable if they use inflateGetHeader() and
 mdeslaur> call inflate() in a loop.
 mdeslaur> This fix caused a regression, see:
 mdeslaur> https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/08/09/1
 mdeslaur> https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/9271
 mdeslaur> The second commit below fixes the regression.

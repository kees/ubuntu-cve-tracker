Description:
 Puma is a simple, fast, multi-threaded, parallel HTTP 1.1 server for
 Ruby/Rack applications. When using Puma behind a proxy that does not
 properly validate that the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230
 standard, Puma and the frontend proxy may disagree on where a request
 starts and ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end
 proxy to Puma. The vulnerability has been fixed in 5.6.4 and 4.3.12. Users
 are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Workaround: when deploying a
 proxy in front of Puma, turning on any and all functionality to make sure
 that the request matches the RFC7230 standard.

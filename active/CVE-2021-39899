Description:
 In all versions of GitLab CE/EE, an attacker with physical access to a
 user’s machine may brute force the user’s password via the change password
 function. There is a rate limit in place, but the attack may still be
 conducted by stealing the session id from the physical compromise of the
 account and splitting the attack over several IP addresses and passing in
 the compromised session value from these various locations.

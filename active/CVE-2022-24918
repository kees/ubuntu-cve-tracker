Description:
 An authenticated user can create a link with reflected Javascript code
 inside it for itemsâ€™ page and send it to other users. The payload can be
 executed only with a known CSRF token value of the victim, which is changed
 periodically and is difficult to predict. Malicious code has access to all
 the same objects as the rest of the web page and can make arbitrary
 modifications to the contents of the page being displayed to a victim
 during social engineering attacks.

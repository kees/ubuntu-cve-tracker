 WordPress through 5.0.3 allows Path Traversal in wp_crop_image(). An
 attacker (who has privileges to crop an image) can write the output image
 to an arbitrary directory via a filename containing two image extensions
 and ../ sequences, such as a filename ending with the .jpg?/../../file.jpg
 substring.

Description:
 A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions of
 OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains that
 include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit this
 vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers
 exponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service
 (DoS) attack on affected systems. Policy processing is disabled by default
 but can be enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line
 utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

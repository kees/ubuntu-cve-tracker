Description:
 Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter. The URI validation on dompdf 2.0.1 can
 be bypassed on SVG parsing by passing `<image>` tags with uppercase
 letters. This may lead to arbitrary object unserialize on PHP < 8, through
 the `phar` URL wrapper. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to call
 arbitrary URL with arbitrary protocols, if they can provide a SVG file to
 dompdf. In PHP versions before 8.0.0, it leads to arbitrary unserialize,
 that will lead to the very least to an arbitrary file deletion and even
 remote code execution, depending on classes that are available.

Description:
 x86/HVM pinned cache attributes mis-handling T[his CNA information record
 relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities
 correspond to which CVE.] To allow cachability control for HVM guests with
 passed through devices, an interface exists to explicitly override defaults
 which would otherwise be put in place. While not exposed to the affected
 guests themselves, the interface specifically exists for domains
 controlling such guests. This interface may therefore be used by not fully
 privileged entities, e.g. qemu running deprivileged in Dom0 or qemu running
 in a so called stub-domain. With this exposure it is an issue that - the
 number of the such controlled regions was unbounded (CVE-2022-42333), -
 installation and removal of such regions was not properly serialized
 (CVE-2022-42334).

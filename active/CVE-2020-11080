Description:
 In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame
 payload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a
 malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400
 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack
 causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability.
 There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement
 nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS
 frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., > 32), then drop
 the connection.

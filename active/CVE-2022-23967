Description:
 In TightVNC 1.3.10, there is an integer signedness error and resultant
 heap-based buffer overflow in InitialiseRFBConnection in rfbproto.c (for
 the vncviewer component). There is no check on the size given to malloc,
 e.g., -1 is accepted. This allocates a chunk of size zero, which will give
 a heap pointer. However, one can send 0xffffffff bytes of data, which can
 have a DoS impact or lead to remote code execution.

Description:
 ntpkeygen can generate keys that ntpd fails to parse. NTPsec 1.2.0 allows
 ntpkeygen to generate keys with '#' characters. ntpd then either pads,
 shortens the key, or fails to load these keys entirely, depending on the
 key type and the placement of the '#'. This results in the administrator
 not being able to use the keys as expected or the keys are shorter than
 expected and easier to brute-force, possibly resulting in MITM attacks
 between ntp clients and ntp servers. For short AES128 keys, ntpd generates
 a warning that it is padding them.

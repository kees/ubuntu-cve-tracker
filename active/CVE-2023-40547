Description:
 A remote code execution vulnerability was found in Shim. The Shim boot
 support trusts attacker-controlled values when parsing an HTTP response.
 This flaw allows an attacker to craft a specific malicious HTTP request,
 leading to a completely controlled out-of-bounds write primitive and
 complete system compromise. This flaw is only exploitable during the early
 boot phase, an attacker needs to perform a Man-in-the-Middle or compromise
 the boot server to be able to exploit this vulnerability successfully.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> UEFI Security Response Team states that dbx update is not needed
 eslerm> secureboot-db should only ever be updated after shim
 eslerm> secureboot-db is not updated on ESM releases as doing so would
 eslerm> revoke install media keys Note that key revocation is required to
 eslerm> protect against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)

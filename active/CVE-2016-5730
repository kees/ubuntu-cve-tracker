Description:
 phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before
 4.6.3 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via vectors
 involving (1) an array value to FormDisplay.php, (2) incorrect data to
 validate.php, (3) unexpected data to Validator.php, (4) a missing config
 directory during setup, or (5) an incorrect OpenID identifier data type,
 which reveals the full path in an error message.

Description:
 Templates do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string
 delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used, since
 ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action
 within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be
 used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the
 Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves
 can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go
 template actions from being used inside of them (e.g., "var a = {{.}}"),
 since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the
 same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template. Parse
 returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode
 of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported but will be exported in
 the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can
 re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that
 backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.

Description:
 savg-sanitizer is a PHP SVG/XML Sanitizer. A bypass has been found in
 versions prior to 0.16.0 that allows an attacker to upload an SVG with
 persistent cross-site scripting. HTML elements within CDATA needed to be
 sanitized correctly, as we were converting them to a textnode and
 therefore, the library wasn't seeing them as DOM elements. This issue is
 fixed in version 0.16.0. Any data within a CDATA node will now be sanitised
 using HTMLPurifier. The maintainers have also removed many of the HTML and
 MathML elements from the allowed element list, as without ForiegnObject,
 they're not legal within the SVG context. There are no known workarounds.

Description:
 A OS Command Injection vulnerability exists in Node.js versions <14.21.1,
 <16.18.1, <18.12.1, <19.0.1 due to an insufficient IsAllowedHost check that
 can easily be bypassed because IsIPAddress does not properly check if an IP
 address is invalid before making DBS requests allowing rebinding
 attacks.The fix for this issue in
 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32212 was
 incomplete and this new CVE is to complete the fix.

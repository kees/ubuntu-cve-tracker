Description:
 Guzzle, an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers
 on requests are sensitive information. In affected versions on making a
 request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different port, if
 we choose to follow it, we should remove the `Authorization` and `Cookie`
 headers from the request, before containing. Previously, we would only
 consider a change in host or scheme. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade
 to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier
 series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a
 partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would
 trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this
 earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port. An
 alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, rather
 than ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expect
 redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.

Description:
 Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to DNS
 rebinding attacks as the whitelist includes “localhost6”. When “localhost6”
 is not present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that is
 resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls the victim's
 DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection can be
 bypassed by using the “localhost6” domain. As long as the attacker uses the
 “localhost6” domain, they can still apply the attack described in
 CVE-2018-7160.

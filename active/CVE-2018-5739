Description:
 An extension to hooks capabilities which debuted in Kea 1.4.0 introduced a
 memory leak for operators who are using certain hooks library facilities.
 In order to support multiple requests simultaneously, Kea 1.4 added a
 callout handle store but unfortunately the initial implementation of this
 store does not properly free memory in every case. Hooks which make use of
 query4 or query6 parameters in their callouts can leak memory, resulting in
 the eventual exhaustion of available memory and subsequent failure of the
 server process. Affects Kea DHCP 1.4.0.

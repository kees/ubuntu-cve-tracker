Description:
 The code that processes control channel messages sent to named calls
 certain functions recursively during packet parsing. Recursion depth is
 only limited by the maximum accepted packet size; depending on the
 environment, this may cause the packet-parsing code to run out of
 available stack memory, causing named to terminate unexpectedly. Since
 each incoming control channel message is fully parsed before its contents
 are authenticated, exploiting this flaw does not require the attacker to
 hold a valid RNDC key; only network access to the control channelâ€™s
 configured TCP port is necessary.

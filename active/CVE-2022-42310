Description:
 Xenstore: Guests can create orphaned Xenstore nodes By creating multiple
 nodes inside a transaction resulting in an error, a malicious guest can
 create orphaned nodes in the Xenstore data base, as the cleanup after the
 error will not remove all nodes already created. When the transaction is
 committed after this situation, nodes without a valid parent can be made
 permanent in the data base.

Description:
 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in
 Apache Solr.
 The Solr Metrics API publishes all unprotected environment variables
 available to each Apache Solr instance. Users are able to specify which
 environment variables to hide, however, the default list is designed to
 work for known secret Java system properties. Environment variables cannot
 be strictly defined in Solr, like Java system properties can be, and may be
 set for the entire host,Â unlike Java system properties which are set
 per-Java-proccess.
 
 The Solr Metrics API is protected by the "metrics-read" permission.
 Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization setup will only be vulnerable via
 users with the "metrics-read" permission.
 This issue affects Apache Solr: from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.
 
 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or later, in which
 environment variables are not published via the Metrics API.

Description:
 The PPM reader in libjpeg-turbo through 2.0.90 mishandles use of
 tjLoadImage for loading a 16-bit binary PPM file into a grayscale buffer
 and loading a 16-bit binary PGM file into an RGB buffer. This is related to
 a heap-based buffer overflow in the get_word_rgb_row function in rdppm.c.

Description:
 When xdg-mail is configured to use thunderbird for mailto URLs, improper
 parsing of the URL can lead to additional headers being passed to
 thunderbird that should not be included per RFC 2368. An attacker can use
 this method to create a mailto URL that looks safe to users, but will
 actually attach files when clicked.

Description:
 In the standard library in Rust before 1.52.0, the Zip implementation has a
 panic safety issue. It calls __iterator_get_unchecked() more than once for
 the same index when the underlying iterator panics (in certain conditions).
 This bug could lead to a memory safety violation due to an unmet safety
 requirement for the TrustedRandomAccess trait.

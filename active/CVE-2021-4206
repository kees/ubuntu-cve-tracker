Description:
 A flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in QEMU. An integer
 overflow in the cursor_alloc() function can lead to the allocation of a
 small cursor object followed by a subsequent heap-based buffer overflow.
 This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest user to crash the QEMU
 process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the
 context of the QEMU process.

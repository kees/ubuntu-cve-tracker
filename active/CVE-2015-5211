Description:
 Under some situations, the Spring Framework 4.2.0 to 4.2.1, 4.0.0 to 4.1.7,
 3.2.0 to 3.2.14 and older unsupported versions is vulnerable to a Reflected
 File Download (RFD) attack. The attack involves a malicious user crafting a
 URL with a batch script extension that results in the response being
 downloaded rather than rendered and also includes some input reflected in
 the response.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Alvaro Mu√±oz discovered that Spring Framework incorrectly handled certain
 URLs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a reflected
 file download.

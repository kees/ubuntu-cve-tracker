Description:
 There an out-of-bounds read at fs/ntfs.c, a physically present attacker may
 leverage that by presenting a specially crafted NTFS file system image to read
 arbitrary memory locations. A successful attack may allow sensitive data cached
 in memory or EFI variables values to be leaked presenting a high
 Confidentiality risk.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that a specially crafted file system image could cause an
 out-of-bounds read. A local attacker could possibly use this to leak sensitive
 information to the GRUB pager.
Notes:
 eslerm> grub2-unsigned contains Secure Boot security fixes
 eslerm> the grub2 package unlikely affects Ubuntu's Secure Boot
 eslerm> grub2 and grub2-unsigned should have same major version
 eslerm| Ubuntu Secure Boot and ESM do not cover i386 trusty's GA kernel
  cannot handle new versions of grub
 eslerm| Note that key revocation is required to protect against evil
  housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)

Description:
 XLookupColor() and other X libraries function lack proper validation
 of the length of their string parameters. If those parameters can be
 controlled by an external application (for instance a color name that
 can be emitted via a terminal control sequence) it can lead to the
 emission of extra X protocol requests to the X server.

Description:
 A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In
 response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an
 httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP
 response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The
 greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and
 availability.

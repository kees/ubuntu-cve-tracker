Description:
 [Netatalk get_finderinfo Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure
 Vulnerability

 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive
 information on affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not
 required to exploit this vulnerability.

 The specific flaw exists within the get_finderinfo method. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can
 result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can
 leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute
 arbitrary code in the context of root.]

Description:
 A previously disclosed vulnerability (CVE-2023-30584) was patched
 insufficiently in commit 205f1e6. The new path traversal vulnerability
 arises because the implementation does not protect itself against the
 application overwriting built-in utility functions with user-defined
 implementations. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the
 permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Description:
 An improper locking issue was found in the virStoragePoolLookupByTargetPath API of libvirt. It occurs in the
 storagePoolLookupByTargetPath function where a locked virStoragePoolObj object is not properly released on ACL
 permission failure. Clients connecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw
 to acquire the lock and prevent other users from accessing storage pool/volume APIs, resulting in a denial of
 service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

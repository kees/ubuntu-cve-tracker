Description:
 libtiff's tiffcrop tool has a uint32_t underflow which leads to out of
 bounds read and write in the extractContigSamples8bits routine. An attacker
 who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop could trigger this flaw, most
 likely by tricking a user into opening the crafted file with tiffcrop.
 Triggering this flaw could cause a crash or potentially further
 exploitation.

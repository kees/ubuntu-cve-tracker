Description:
 A vulnerability was found in GnuTLS. The response times to malformed
 ciphertexts in RSA-PSK ClientKeyExchange differ from response times of
 ciphertexts with correct PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This issue may allow a remote
 attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack in the RSA-PSK key
 exchange, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive data.
 CVE-2024-0553 is designated as an incomplete resolution for CVE-2023-5981.

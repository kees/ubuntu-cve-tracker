Description:
 The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective,
 thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues
 previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a
 malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting
 in a denial of service or potential code execution. QEMU up to (including)
 5.2.0 is affected by this.

Description:
 In ssh in OpenSSH before 9.6, OS command injection might occur if a user
 name or host name has shell metacharacters, and this name is referenced by
 an expansion token in certain situations. For example, an untrusted Git
 repository can have a submodule with shell metacharacters in a user name or
 host name.

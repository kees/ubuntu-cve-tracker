Description:
 A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js version 20, affecting users
 of the experimental permission model when the --allow-fs-read flag is used
 with a non-* argument. This flaw arises from an inadequate permission model
 that fails to restrict file stats through the `fs.statfs` API. As a result,
 malicious actors can retrieve stats from files that they do not have
 explicit read access to. This vulnerability affects all users using the
 experimental permission model in Node.js 20. Please note that at the time
 this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of
 Node.js.

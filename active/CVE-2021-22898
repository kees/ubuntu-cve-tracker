Description:
 curl 7.7 through 7.76.1 suffers from an information disclosure when the
 `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is
 used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to a flaw in the
 option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass
 on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the server, resulting in
 potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a
 clear-text network protocol.

Description:
 This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary
 code on affected installations of Synology DiskStation Manager.
 Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerablity. The specific
 flaw exists within the processing of DSI structures in Netatalk. The issue
 results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied
 data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage
 this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
 Was ZDI-CAN-12326.

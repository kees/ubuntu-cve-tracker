Description:
 A flaw was found in the python-cryptography package. This issue may allow a
 remote attacker to decrypt captured messages in TLS servers that use RSA
 key exchanges, which may lead to exposure of confidential or sensitive
 data.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> as of 2024-02-19, there doesn't appear to be an upstream fix for
 mdeslaur> this issue
 litios> The issue is in OpenSSL, fixed in 3.2.0. Once OpenSSL fix
 litios> is backported, a no-change rebuild of cryptography would
 litios> be needed to fix the vulnerability.

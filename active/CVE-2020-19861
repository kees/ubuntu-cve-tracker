 https://github.com/NLnetLabs/ldns/issues/51
Description:
 When a zone file in ldns 1.7.1 is parsed, the function ldns_nsec3_salt_data
 is too trusted for the length value obtained from the zone file. When the
 memcpy is copied, the 0xfe - ldns_rdf_size(salt_rdf) byte data can be
 copied, causing heap overflow information leakage.

Description:
 The use-after-free vulnerability was found in the AuthentIC driver in
 OpenSC packages, occuring in the card enrolment process using pkcs15-init
 when a user or administrator enrols or modifies cards. An attacker must
 have physical access to the computer system and requires a crafted USB
 device or smart card to present the system with specially crafted responses
 to the APDUs, which are considered high complexity and low severity. This
 manipulation can allow for compromised card management operations during
 enrolment.

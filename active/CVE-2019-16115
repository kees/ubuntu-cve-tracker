Description:
 In Xpdf 4.01.01, a stack-based buffer under-read could be triggered in
 IdentityFunction::transform in Function.cc, used by
 GfxAxialShading::getColor. It can, for example, be triggered by sending a
 crafted PDF document to the pdftoppm tool. It allows an attacker to use a
 crafted PDF file to cause Denial of Service or possibly unspecified other
 impact.

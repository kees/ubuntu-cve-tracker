Description:
 The free_options function in options_manager.c in mp3splt 2.6.2 allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
 crash) via a crafted file.  NOTE: this typically has no risk; this crash of
 this command-line program has no further consequences for availability.

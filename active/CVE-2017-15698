Description:
 When parsing the AIA-Extension field of a client certificate, Apache Tomcat
 Native Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.1.23 to 1.1.34 did not correctly
 handle fields longer than 127 bytes. The result of the parsing error was to
 skip the OCSP check. It was therefore possible for client certificates that
 should have been rejected (if the OCSP check had been made) to be accepted.
 Users not using OCSP checks are not affected by this vulnerability.

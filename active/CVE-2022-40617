Description:
 Because the revocation plugin uses potentially untrusted OCSP URIs and
 CRL distribution points (CDP) in certificates, a remote attacker is able
 to initiate IKE_SAs and send crafted certificates that contain URIs
 pointing to servers under their control, which can lead to a
 denial-of-service attack.  Affected are all strongSwan versions,
 including the latest 5.9.7.

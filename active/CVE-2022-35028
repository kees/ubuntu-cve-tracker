Description:
 OTFCC commit 617837b was discovered to contain a segmentation violation via
 /release-x64/otfccdump+0x4fbbb6.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> debian claims oftccdump is not built in texlive-bin,
   which is technically correct and thus not affected; however, the
   underlying oftcc source files get compiled into the mflua binary,
   and it's not clear from all these reports whether or not it is
   affected by these fuzzing findings.

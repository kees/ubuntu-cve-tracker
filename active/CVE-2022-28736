Description:
 There's a use-after-free vulnerability in grub_cmd_chainloader() function;
 The chainloader command is used to boot up operating systems that doesn't
 support multiboot and do not have direct support from GRUB2. When
 executing chainloader more than once a use-after-free vulnerability is
 triggered. If an attacker can control the GRUB2's memory allocation
 pattern sensitive data may be exposed and arbitrary code execution can be
 achieved.

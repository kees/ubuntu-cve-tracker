Description:
 Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.30.9, 2.31.8, 2.32.7,
 2.33.8, 2.34.8, 2.35.8, 2.36.6, 2.37.7, 2.38.5, 2.39.3, and 2.40.1, a
 specially crafted `.gitmodules` file with submodule URLs that are longer
 than 1024 characters can used to exploit a bug in
 `config.c::git_config_copy_or_rename_section_in_file()`. This bug can be
 used to inject arbitrary configuration into a user's `$GIT_DIR/config` when
 attempting to remove the configuration section associated with that
 submodule. When the attacker injects configuration values which specify
 executables to run (such as `core.pager`, `core.editor`, `core.sshCommand`,
 etc.) this can lead to a remote code execution. A fix A fix is available in
 versions 2.30.9, 2.31.8, 2.32.7, 2.33.8, 2.34.8, 2.35.8, 2.36.6, 2.37.7,
 2.38.5, 2.39.3, and 2.40.1. As a workaround, avoid running `git submodule
 deinit` on untrusted repositories or without prior inspection of any
 submodule sections in `$GIT_DIR/config`.

Description:
 A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in bluetoothd in BlueZ through
 5.48. There isn't any check on whether there is enough space in the
 destination buffer. The function simply appends all data passed to it. The
 values of all attributes that are requested are appended to the output
 buffer. There are no size checks whatsoever, resulting in a simple heap
 overflow if one can craft a request where the response is large enough to
 overflow the preallocated buffer. This issue exists in service_attr_req
 gets called by process_request (in sdpd-request.c), which also allocates
 the response buffer.

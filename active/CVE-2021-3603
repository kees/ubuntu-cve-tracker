Description:
 PHPMailer 6.4.1 and earlier contain a vulnerability that can result in
 untrusted code being called (if such code is injected into the host
 project's scope by other means). If the $patternselect parameter to
 validateAddress() is set to 'php' (the default, defined by
 PHPMailer::$validator), and the global namespace contains a function called
 php, it will be called in preference to the built-in validator of the same
 name. Mitigated in PHPMailer 6.5.0 by denying the use of simple strings as
 validator function names.

Description:
 telnetd in GNU Inetutils through 2.3, MIT krb5-appl through 1.0.3, and
 derivative works has a NULL pointer dereference via 0xff 0xf7 or 0xff 0xf8.
 In a typical installation, the telnetd application would crash but the
 telnet service would remain available through inetd. However, if the
 telnetd application has many crashes within a short time interval, the
 telnet service would become unavailable after inetd logs a "telnet/tcp
 server failing (looping), service terminated" error. NOTE: MIT krb5-appl is
 not supported upstream but is shipped by a few Linux distributions. The
 affected code was removed from the supported MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5)
 product many years ago, at version 1.8.

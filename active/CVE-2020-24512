Description: 
 Observable timing discrepancy in some Intel(R) Processors may allow
 an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure
 via local access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Travis Downs discovered that some Intel processors did not properly flush
 cache-lines for trivial-data values. This may allow an unauthorized user to
 infer the presence of these trivial-data-cache-lines via timing sidechannel
 attacks. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.

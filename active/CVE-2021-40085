Description: 
 By supplying a specially crafted extra_dhcp_opts value, an authenticated
 user may add arbitrary configuration to the dnsmasq process in order to
 crash the service, change parameters for other tenants sharing the same
 interface, or otherwise alter that daemon's behavior. This vulnerability
 may also be used to trigger a configuration parsing buffer overflow
 in versions of dnsmasq prior to 2.81, which could lead to remote code
 execution.

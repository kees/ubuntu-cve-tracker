Description:
 An OpenPGP digital signature includes information about the date when the signature was
 created. When displaying an email that contains a digital signature, the email's date
 will be shown. If the dates were different, then Thunderbird didn't report the email as
 having an invalid signature. If an attacker performed a replay attack, in which an old
 email with old contents are resent at a later time, it could lead the victim to believe
 that the statements in the email are current. Fixed versions of Thunderbird will require
 that the signature's date roughly matches the displayed date of the email.

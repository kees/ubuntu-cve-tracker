Description:
 Python-RSA before 4.1 ignores leading '\0' bytes during decryption of
 ciphertext. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact, e.g.,
 by helping an attacker to infer that an application uses Python-RSA, or if
 the length of accepted ciphertext affects application behavior (such as by
 causing excessive memory allocation).

Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** tools/url_handler.pl in TIN 2.4.1 does not validate strings
 before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable,
 which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks
 via a crafted URL. NOTE: a third party has reported that this is
 intentional behavior, because the documentation states "url_handler.pl was
 designed to work together with tin which only issues shell escaped absolute
 URLs."

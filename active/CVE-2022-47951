Description:
 An issue was discovered in OpenStack Cinder before 19.1.2, 20.x before
 20.0.2, and 21.0.0; Glance before 23.0.1, 24.x before 24.1.1, and 25.0.0;
 and Nova before 24.1.2, 25.x before 25.0.2, and 26.0.0. By supplying a
 specially created VMDK flat image that references a specific backing file
 path, an authenticated user may convince systems to return a copy of that
 file's contents from the server, resulting in unauthorized access to
 potentially sensitive data.

Description:
 Under certain circumstances, the Drupal core form API evaluates form
 element access incorrectly. This may lead to a user being able to alter
 data they should not have access to. No forms provided by Drupal core are
 known to be vulnerable. However, forms added through contributed or custom
 modules or themes may be affected.

Description:
 A resource leak in gw_backend.c in lighttpd 1.4.56 through 1.4.66 could
 lead to a denial of service (connection-slot exhaustion) after a large
 amount of anomalous TCP behavior by clients. It is related to RDHUP
 mishandling in certain HTTP/1.1 chunked situations. Use of mod_fastcgi is,
 for example, affected. This is fixed in 1.4.67.

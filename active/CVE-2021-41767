Description:
 Apache Guacamole 1.3.0 and older may incorrectly include a private tunnel
 identifier in the non-private details of some REST responses. This may
 allow an authenticated user who already has permission to access a
 particular connection to read from or interact with another user's active
 use of that same connection.

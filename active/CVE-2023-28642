Description:
 runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI
 specification. It was found that AppArmor can be bypassed when `/proc`
 inside the container is symlinked with a specific mount configuration. This
 issue has been fixed in runc version 1.1.5, by prohibiting symlinked
 `/proc`. See PR #3785 for details. users are advised to upgrade. Users
 unable to upgrade should avoid using an untrusted container image.

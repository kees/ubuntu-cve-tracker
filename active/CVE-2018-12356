Description:
 An issue was discovered in password-store.sh in pass in Simple Password
 Store 1.7.x before 1.7.2. The signature verification routine parses the
 output of GnuPG with an incomplete regular expression, which allows remote
 attackers to spoof file signatures on configuration files and extension
 scripts. Modifying the configuration file allows the attacker to inject
 additional encryption keys under their control, thereby disclosing
 passwords to the attacker. Modifying the extension scripts allows the
 attacker arbitrary code execution.

Description:
 RT's native login system is vulnerable to user enumeration through a
 timing side-channel attack. This means an external entity could try
 to find valid usernames by attempting logins and comparing the time
 to evaluate each login attempt for valid and invalid usernames. This
 vulnerability does not allow any access to the RT system.

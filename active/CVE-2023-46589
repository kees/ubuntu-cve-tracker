Description:
 Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.Tomcat from
 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.15, from 9.0.0-M1
 through 9.0.82 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.95 did not correctly parse HTTP
 trailer headers. A trailer header that exceeded the header size limit could
 cause Tomcat to treat a single request as multiple requests leading to the
 possibility of request smuggling when behind a reverse proxy. Users are
 recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M11 onwards, 10.1.16 onwards,
 9.0.83 onwards or 8.5.96 onwards, which fix the issue.

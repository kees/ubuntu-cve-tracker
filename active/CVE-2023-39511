Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting
 (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data
 stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by
 administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's
 browser at view-time. The script under `reports_admin.php` displays
 reporting information about graphs, devices, data sources etc. _CENSUS_
 found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious device name,
 related to a graph attached to a report, can deploy a stored XSS attack
 against any super user who has privileges of viewing the
 `reports_admin.php` page, such as administrative accounts. A user that
 possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can
 configure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through
 `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload is
 exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/reports_admin.php` when the a graph with
 the maliciously altered device name is linked to the report. This issue has
 been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
 unable to upgrade should manually filter HTML output.

Description:
 WireGuard, such as WireGuard 0.5.3 on Windows, does not fully account for
 the possibility that an adversary might be able to set a victim's system
 time to a future value, e.g., because unauthenticated NTP is used. This can
 lead to an outcome in which one static private key becomes permanently
 useless.

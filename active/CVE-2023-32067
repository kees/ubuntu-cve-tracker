Description:
 c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. c-ares is vulnerable to denial
 of service. If a target resolver sends a query, the attacker forges a
 malformed UDP packet with a length of 0 and returns them to the target
 resolver. The target resolver erroneously interprets the 0 length as a
 graceful shutdown of the connection. This issue has been patched in version
 1.19.1.

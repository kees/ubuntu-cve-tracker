Description:
 LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros within
 documents, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the document
 occurred since the last signing and that the signature is valid. An
 Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an
 attacker to create a digitally signed ODF document, by manipulating the
 documentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream within the document to
 combine multiple certificate data, which when opened caused LibreOffice to
 display a validly signed indicator but whose content was unrelated to the
 signature shown. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice
 7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6; 7-1 versions prior to 7.1.2.

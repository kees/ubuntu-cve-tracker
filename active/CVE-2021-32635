Description:
 ### Impact Due to incorrect use of a default URL, `singularity` action
 commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) specifying a container using a `library://`
 URI will always attempt to retrieve the container from the default remote
 endpoint (`cloud.sylabs.io`) rather than the configured remote endpoint. An
 attacker may be able to push a malicious container to the default remote
 endpoint with a URI that is identical to the URI used by a victim with a
 non-default remote endpoint, thus executing the malicious container. Only
 action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) against `library://` URIs are
 affected. Other commands such as `pull` / `push` respect the configured
 remote endpoint. ### Patches All users should upgrade to Singularity 3.7.4
 or later. ### Workarounds Users who only interact with the default remote
 endpoint are not affected. Installations with an execution control list
 configured to restrict execution to containers signed with specific secure
 keys are not affected. ### For more information General questions about the
 impact of the advisory can be asked in the: - [SingularityCE Slack
 Channel](https://singularityce.slack.com) - [SingularityCE Mailing
 List](https://groups.google.com/g/singularity-ce) Any sensitive security

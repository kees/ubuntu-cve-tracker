Description:
 Singularity is an open source container platform. In verions 3.7.2 and
 3.7.3, Dde to incorrect use of a default URL, `singularity` action commands
 (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) specifying a container using a `library://` URI will
 always attempt to retrieve the container from the default remote endpoint
 (`cloud.sylabs.io`) rather than the configured remote endpoint. An attacker
 may be able to push a malicious container to the default remote endpoint
 with a URI that is identical to the URI used by a victim with a non-default
 remote endpoint, thus executing the malicious container. Only action
 commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) against `library://` URIs are affected.
 Other commands such as `pull` / `push` respect the configured remote
 endpoint. The vulnerability is patched in Singularity version 3.7.4. Two
 possible workarounds exist: Users can only interact with the default remote
 endpoint, or an installation can have an execution control list configured
 to restrict execution to containers signed with specific secure keys.

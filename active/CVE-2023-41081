Description:
 Important: Authentication Bypass CVE-2023-41081 The mod_jk component of
 Apache Tomcat Connectors in some circumstances, such as when a
 configuration included "JkOptions +ForwardDirectories" but the
 configuration did not provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied
 requests, mod_jk would use an implicit mapping and map the request to the
 first defined worker. Such an implicit mapping could result in the
 unintended exposure of the status worker and/or bypass security constraints
 configured in httpd. As of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality
 has been removed and all mappings must now be via explicit configuration.
 Only mod_jk is affected by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not
 affected. This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only): from
 1.2.0 through 1.2.48. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49,
 which fixes the issue. History 2023-09-13 Original advisory 2023-09-28

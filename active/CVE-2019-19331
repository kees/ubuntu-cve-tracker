Description:
 knot-resolver before version 4.3.0 is vulnerable to denial of service
 through high CPU utilization. DNS replies with very many resource records
 might be processed very inefficiently, in extreme cases taking even several
 CPU seconds for each such uncached message. For example, a few thousand A
 records can be squashed into one DNS message (limit is 64kB).

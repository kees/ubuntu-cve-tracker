Description:
 The target's backtrace indicates that libc has detected a heap error or
 that the target was executing a heap function when it stopped. This could
 be due to heap corruption, passing a bad pointer to a heap function such as
 free(), etc. Since heap errors might include buffer overflows,
 use-after-free situations, etc. they are generally considered exploitable.

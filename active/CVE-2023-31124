Description:
 When cross-compiling c-ares and using the autotools build system,
 CARES_RANDOM_FILE will not be set, as seen when cross compiling aarch64
 android. This will downgrade to using rand() as a fallback which could
 allow an attacker to take advantage of the lack of entropy by not using
 a CSPRNG.

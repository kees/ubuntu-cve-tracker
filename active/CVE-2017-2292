Description:
 Versions of MCollective prior to 2.10.4 deserialized YAML from agents
 without calling safe_load, allowing the potential for arbitrary code
 execution on the server. The fix for this is to call YAML.safe_load on
 input. This has been tested in all Puppet-supplied MCollective plugins, but
 there is a chance that third-party plugins could rely on this insecure
 behavior.

Description:
 Certifi is a curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the
 trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS
 hosts. Certifi prior to version 2023.07.22 recognizes "e-Tugra" root
 certificates. e-Tugra's root certificates were subject to an investigation
 prompted by reporting of security issues in their systems. Certifi
 2023.07.22 removes root certificates from "e-Tugra" from the root store.

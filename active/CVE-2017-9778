Description:
 GNU Debugger (GDB) 8.0 and earlier fails to detect a negative length field
 in a DWARF section. A malformed section in an ELF binary or a core file can
 cause GDB to repeatedly allocate memory until a process limit is reached.
 This can, for example, impede efforts to analyze malware with GDB.

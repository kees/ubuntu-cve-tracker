Description:
 [Netatalk getdirparams Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure
 Vulnerability

 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive
 information on affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not
 required to exploit this vulnerability.

 The specific flaw exists within the getdirparams method. The issue results
 from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result
 in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage
 this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in
 the context of root.]

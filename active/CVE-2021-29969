Description:
 If Thunderbird was configured to use STARTTLS for an IMAP connection, and
 an attacker injected IMAP server responses prior to the completion of the
 STARTTLS handshake, then Thunderbird didn't ignore the injected data. This
 could have resulted in Thunderbird showing incorrect information, for
 example the attacker could have tricked Thunderbird to show folders that
 didn't exist on the IMAP server. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
 78.12.

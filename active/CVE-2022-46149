Description:
 Cap'n Proto is a data interchange format and remote procedure call (RPC)
 system. Cap'n Proro prior to versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1, 0.9.2, and 0.10.3, as
 well as versions of Cap'n Proto's Rust implementation prior to 0.13.7,
 0.14.11, and 0.15.2 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read due to logic error
 handling list-of-list. This issue may lead someone to remotely segfault a
 peer by sending it a malicious message, if the victim performs certain
 actions on a list-of-pointer type. Exfiltration of memory is possible if
 the victim performs additional certain actions on a list-of-pointer type.
 To be vulnerable, an application must perform a specific sequence of
 actions, described in the GitHub Security Advisory. The bug is present in
 inlined code, therefore the fix will require rebuilding dependent
 applications. Cap'n Proto has C++ fixes available in versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1,
 0.9.2, and 0.10.3. The `capnp` Rust crate has fixes available in versions
 0.13.7, 0.14.11, and 0.15.2.

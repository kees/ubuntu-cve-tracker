Description:
 SnakeYaml's Constructor() class does not restrict types which can be
 instantiated during deserialization. Deserializing yaml content provided by
 an attacker can lead to remote code execution. We recommend using
 SnakeYaml's SafeConsturctor when parsing untrusted content to restrict
 deserialization. We recommend upgrading to version 2.0 and beyond.

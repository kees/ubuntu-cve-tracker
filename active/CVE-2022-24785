Description:
 Moment.js is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating,
 manipulating, and formatting dates. A path traversal vulnerability impacts
 npm (server) users of Moment.js between versions 1.0.1 and 2.29.1,
 especially if a user-provided locale string is directly used to switch
 moment locale. This problem is patched in 2.29.2, and the patch can be
 applied to all affected versions. As a workaround, sanitize the
 user-provided locale name before passing it to Moment.js.

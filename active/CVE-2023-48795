Description:
 Prefix truncation attack on BPP: By manipulating sequence numbers during
 the handshake, an attacker can remove the initial messages on the secure
 channel without causing a MAC failure.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices
 seth-arnold> that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not
 seth-arnold> provide security support for this package if doing so would
 seth-arnold> prevent access to equipment.
 jdstrand> snapd contains an embedded copy of golang-go.crypto
 jdstrand> lxd in 18.04 LTS and earlier contains an embedded copy of
 jdstrand> golang-go.crypto
 sbeattie> proftpd-dfsg contains an ssh implementation in mod-sftp
  (distributed in proftpd-mod-crypto/proftpd-basic)
 mdeslaur> Per upstream openssh developers:
  While cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack
  is fortunately very limited as it only allows deletion of
  consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of
  the protocol prevents user user authentication from proceeding and
  results in a stuck connection.
  The most serious identified impact is that it lets a MITM to
  delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication
  starts, allowing the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke
  timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5. There is no
  other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity.

Description:
 DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using lzo decompression.
 Integer overflow in matroskademux element in lzo decompression function
 which causes a segfault, or could cause a heap overwrite, depending on libc
 and OS. Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it
 could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for
 large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault (because
 the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size
 of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However, if
 using a libc implementation that does not use mmap, or if the OS does not
 support mmap while using libc, then this could result in a heap overwrite.

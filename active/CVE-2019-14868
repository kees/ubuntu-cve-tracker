Description:
 In ksh version 20120801, a flaw was found in the way it evaluates certain
 environment variables. An attacker could use this flaw to override or
 bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands. Services and
 applications that allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide one of
 those environment variables could allow them to exploit this issue
 remotely.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Korn Shell incorrectly handled environment
 variables. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute
 arbitrary code.

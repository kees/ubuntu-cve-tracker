Description:
 An improper certificate validation vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 in
 the way it supports matching of wildcard patterns when listed as "Subject
 Alternative Name" in TLS server certificates. curl can be built to use its
 own name matching function for TLS rather than one provided by a TLS
 library. This private wildcard matching function would match IDN
 (International Domain Name) hosts incorrectly and could as a result accept
 patterns that otherwise should mismatch. IDN hostnames are converted to
 puny code before used for certificate checks. Puny coded names always start
 with `xn--` and should not be allowed to pattern match, but the wildcard
 check in curl could still check for `x*`, which would match even though the
 IDN name most likely contained nothing even resembling an `x`.

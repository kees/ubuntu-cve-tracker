Description:
 An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in Shim when it tried to validate the
 SBAT information. This issue may expose sensitive data during the system's
 boot phase.
Ubuntu-Description:
 [Fix an out-of-bound read in verify_buffer_sbat()
 In verify_buffer_sbat(), we have a goal-seeking loop to find the .sbat
 section header.  Unfortunately, while the actual contents of the section
 are checked for being inside the binary, no such check exists for the
 contents of the section table entry.
 As a result, a carefully constructed binary will cause an out-of-bounds
 read checking if the section name is ".sbat\0\0\0" or not.
 This patch adds a check that each section table entry is within the
 bounds of the binary.
 It's not currently known if this is actually exploitable beyond creating
 a denial of service, and an attacker who is in a position to use it for
 a denial of service attack must already be able to do so.]
Notes:
 eslerm| secureboot-db should only ever be updated after shim
 eslerm| secureboot-db is not updated on ESM releases as doing so would
 eslerm| revoke install media keys Note that key revocation is required to
 eslerm| protect against evil housekeeper attacks (such as BlackLotus)
 eslerm| see also e7f5fdf ("pe-relocate: Ensure nothing else implements
  CVE-2023-40550")

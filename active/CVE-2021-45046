Description:
 It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0
 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows
 attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the
 logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a
 Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map
 pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI
 Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS) attack. Log4j 2.15.0
 restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Note that previous
 mitigations involving configuration such as to set the system property
 `log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup` to `true` do NOT mitigate this specific
 vulnerability. Log4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for
 message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default. This
 issue can be mitigated in prior releases (<2.16.0) by removing the
 JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar
 org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class).

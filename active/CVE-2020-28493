Description:
 This affects the package jinja2 from 0.0.0 and before 2.11.3. The ReDoS
 vulnerability is mainly due to the `_punctuation_re regex` operator and its
 use of multiple wildcards. The last wildcard is the most exploitable as it
 searches for trailing punctuation. This issue can be mitigated by Markdown
 to format user content instead of the urlize filter, or by implementing
 request timeouts and limiting process memory.

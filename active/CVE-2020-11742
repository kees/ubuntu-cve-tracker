Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to
 cause a denial of service because of bad continuation handling in
 GNTTABOP_copy. Grant table operations are expected to return 0 for success,
 and a negative number for errors. The fix for CVE-2017-12135 introduced a
 path through grant copy handling where success may be returned to the
 caller without any action taken. In particular, the status fields of
 individual operations are left uninitialised, and may result in errant
 behaviour in the caller of GNTTABOP_copy. A buggy or malicious guest can
 construct its grant table in such a way that, when a backend domain tries
 to copy a grant, it hits the incorrect exit path. This returns success to
 the caller without doing anything, which may cause crashes or other
 incorrect behaviour.

Description:
 In Ansible, all Ansible Engine versions up to ansible-engine 2.8.5,
 ansible-engine 2.7.13, ansible-engine 2.6.19, were logging at the DEBUG
 level which lead to a disclosure of credentials if a plugin used a library
 that logged credentials at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect
 Ansible modules, as those are executed in a separate process.

Description:
 Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s
 command is larger than what fits into a (signed) long variable, abort with
 e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash
 may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in
 commit `ac6378773` which has been included in release version 9.0.2108.
 Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
 vulnerability.

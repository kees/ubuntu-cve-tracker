Description:
 Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 are vulnerable to
 a use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS
 enabled socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a
 freshly allocated WriteWrap object as first argument. If the DoWrite method
 does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as part
 of a StreamWriteResult structure. This may be exploited to corrupt memory
 leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other exploits.

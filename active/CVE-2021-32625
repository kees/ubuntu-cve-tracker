Description:
 Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store,
 used as a database, cache, and message broker. An integer overflow bug in
 Redis version 6.0 or newer, could be exploited using the STRALGO LCS
 command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code
 execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix by CVE-2021-29477. The
 problem is fixed in version 6.2.4 and 6.0.14. An additional workaround to
 mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to use
 ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the STRALGO LCS command. On
 64 bit systems which have the fixes of CVE-2021-29477 (6.2.3 or 6.0.13), it
 is sufficient to make sure that the proto-max-bulk-len config parameter is
 smaller than 2GB (default is 512MB).

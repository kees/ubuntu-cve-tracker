Description:
 In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, the etcd gateway is a simple TCP
 proxy to allow for basic service discovery and access. However, it is
 possible to include the gateway address as an endpoint. This results in a
 denial of service, since the endpoint can become stuck in a loop of
 requesting itself until there are no more available file descriptors to
 accept connections on the gateway.

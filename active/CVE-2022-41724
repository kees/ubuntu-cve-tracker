Description:
 Large handshake records may cause panics in crypto/tls. Both clients and
 servers may send large TLS handshake records which cause servers and
 clients, respectively, to panic when attempting to construct responses.
 This affects all TLS 1.3 clients, TLS 1.2 clients which explicitly enable
 session resumption (by setting Config.ClientSessionCache to a non-nil
 value), and TLS 1.3 servers which request client certificates (by setting
 Config.ClientAuth >= RequestClientCert).

Description:
 It was found that the system umask policy is not being honored when
 creating XDG user directories (~/Desktop etc) on first login. This could
 lead to user's files being inadvertently exposed to other local users.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> This feels like a fundamental misunderstanding of Unix model to
  assume that every task run on behalf of a user will be started as a child
  process of bash or sh run as an interactive or login shell.
 seth-arnold> Environments that want a specific umask set for users should use
  the pam_umask(8) module as part of the login process.
 seth-arnold> Environments that need a specific umask set for compliance reasons
  should investigate the feasibility of preparing a single-purpose LSM or
  seccomp jail interface of some sort.
 rodrigo-zaiden> pam_umask is being used to set umask when an interactive
  session is started, so Ubuntu is not affected by this CVE.

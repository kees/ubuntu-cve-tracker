Description:
 For an AJP 400 response, EAP 7 is improperly sending two response
 packets and those 'END RESPONSE' packets have the reuse flag set even
 though JBoss does close the connection. So when httpd reuses that
 connection after a 400 for something like a cping, it will receive a
 failure since it reads in the second SEND_HEADERS response packet
 instead of a CPONG.

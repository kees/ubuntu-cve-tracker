Description:
 When curl < 7.84.0 saves cookies, alt-svc and hsts data to local files, it
 makes the operation atomic by finalizing the operation with a rename from a
 temporary name to the final target file name.In that rename operation, it
 might accidentally *widen* the permissions for the target file, leaving the
 updated file accessible to more users than intended.

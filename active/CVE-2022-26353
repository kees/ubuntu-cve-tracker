Description:
 A flaw was found in the virtio-net device of QEMU. This flaw was
 inadvertently introduced with the fix for CVE-2021-3748, which forgot to
 unmap the cached virtqueue elements on error, leading to memory leakage,
 use-after-free or other unexpected results. A malicious privileged guest
 could exploit this issue to crash QEMU or potentially execute arbitrary
 code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.

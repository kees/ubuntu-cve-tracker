Description:
 A bug in QEMU could cause a guest I/O operation otherwise addressed to an
 arbitrary disk offset to be targeted to offset 0 instead (potentially
 overwriting the VM's boot code). This could be used, for example, by L2
 guests with a virtual disk (vdiskL2) stored on a virtual disk of an L1
 (vdiskL1) hypervisor to read and/or write data to LBA 0 of vdiskL1,
 potentially gaining control of L1 at its next reboot.

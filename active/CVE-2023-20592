 machine (VM) memory integrity.

Notes:
 alexmurray> As of 2023-11-15 there doesn't appear to be an official
  microcode update within the upstream linux-firmware repository although
  commit 06afd7f939c5b245b2af9e0fee13026f2aaf77fa looks suspiciously likely
  as it is the only recent commit for the microcode for 3rd generation EPYC
  processors which are the ones listed as affected by the upstream
  advisory. The upstream advisory AMD-SB-3005 mentions microcode revisions
  that were contained in the older commit
  b250b32ab1d044953af2dc5e790819a7703b7ee6 which was provided via USN-6319-1
  so it is not clear what the official fix is for this at this time.

Description:
 WordPress before 5.1.1 does not properly filter comment content, leading to
 Remote Code Execution by unauthenticated users in a default configuration.
 This occurs because CSRF protection is mishandled, and because Search
 Engine Optimization of A elements is performed incorrectly, leading to XSS.
 The XSS results in administrative access, which allows arbitrary changes to
 .php files. This is related to wp-admin/includes/ajax-actions.php and
 wp-includes/comment.php.

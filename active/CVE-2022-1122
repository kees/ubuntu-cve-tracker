Description:
 A flaw was found in the opj2_decompress program in openjpeg2 2.4.0 in the
 way it handles an input directory with a large number of files. When it
 fails to allocate a buffer to store the filenames of the input directory,
 it calls free() on an uninitialized pointer, leading to a segmentation
 fault and a denial of service.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> this only affects the opj_decompress tool in the liopenjp2-tools
 mdeslaur> universe package
 ccdm94> this issue does not affect package openjpeg (versions 1.x) as the
 ccdm94> code that causes the uninitialized pointer to be freed was introduced 
 ccdm94> by PR https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/pull/740. The code does
 ccdm94> contain memory leak problems, but since nothing is freed, the 
 ccdm94> vulnerability in this case does not exist.

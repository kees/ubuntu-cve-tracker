Description:
 Spring Security, versions 5.7 prior to 5.7.5, and 5.6 prior to 5.6.9, and
 older unsupported versions could be susceptible to a privilege escalation
 under certain conditions. A malicious user or attacker can modify a request
 initiated by the Client (via the browser) to the Authorization Server which
 can lead to a privilege escalation on the subsequent approval. This
 scenario can happen if the Authorization Server responds with an OAuth2
 Access Token Response containing an empty scope list (per RFC 6749, Section
 5.1) on the subsequent request to the token endpoint to obtain the access
 token.

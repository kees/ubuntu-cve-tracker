Description:
 A vulnerability in the OLE2 file format parser of ClamAV could allow an
 unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
 condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to an incorrect
 check for end-of-string values during scanning, which may result in a heap
 buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
 submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV
 on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
 cause the ClamAV scanning process to terminate, resulting in a DoS
 condition on the affected software and consuming available system
 resources. For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog .

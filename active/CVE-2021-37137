Description:
 The Snappy frame decoder function doesn't restrict the chunk length which
 may lead to excessive memory usage. Beside this it also may buffer reserved
 skippable chunks until the whole chunk was received which may lead to
 excessive memory usage as well. This vulnerability can be triggered by
 supplying malicious input that decompresses to a very big size (via a
 network stream or a file) or by sending a huge skippable chunk.

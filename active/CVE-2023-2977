Description:
 A vulnerbility was found in OpenSC. This security flaw cause a buffer
 overrun vulnerability in pkcs15 cardos_have_verifyrc_package. The attacker
 can supply a smart card package with malformed ASN1 context. The
 cardos_have_verifyrc_package function scans the ASN1 buffer for 2 tags,
 where remaining length is wrongly caculated due to moved starting pointer.
 This leads to possible heap-based buffer oob read. In cases where ASAN is
 enabled while compiling this causes a crash. Further info leak or more
 damage is possible.

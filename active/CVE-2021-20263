Description:
 A flaw was found in the virtio-fs shared file system daemon (virtiofsd) of
 QEMU. The new 'xattrmap' option may cause the 'security.capability' xattr
 in the guest to not drop on file write, potentially leading to a modified,
 privileged executable in the guest. In rare circumstances, this flaw could
 be used by a malicious user to elevate their privileges within the guest.

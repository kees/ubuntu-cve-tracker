Description:
 Multiple exploitable integer overflow vulnerabilities exist within the
 MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content
 library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an integer
 overflow due to unchecked arithmetic resulting in a heap-based buffer
 overflow that causes memory corruption. After validating the number of
 ranges, at [41] the library will multiply the count by the size of the
 GF_SubsegmentRangeInfo structure. On a 32-bit platform, this multiplication
 can result in an integer overflow causing the space of the array being
 allocated to be less than expected. An attacker can convince a user to open
 a video to trigger this vulnerability.

Description:
 Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the
 Matrix.org Foundation. If Synapse and a malicious homeserver are both
 joined to the same room, the malicious homeserver can trick Synapse into
 accepting previously rejected events into its view of the current state of
 that room. This can be exploited in a way that causes all further messages
 and state changes sent in that room from the vulnerable homeserver to be
 rejected. This issue has been patched in version 1.68.0

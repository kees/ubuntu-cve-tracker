Description:
 When rendering certain unicode sequences, grub2's font code doesn't proper
 validate if the informed glyph's width and height is constrained within
 bitmap size. As consequence an attacker can craft an input which will lead
 to a out-of-bounds write into grub2's heap, leading to memory corruption
 and availability issues. Although complex, arbitrary code execution could
 not be discarded.

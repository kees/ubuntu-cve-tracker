Description:
 PyJWT is a Python implementation of RFC 7519. PyJWT supports multiple
 different JWT signing algorithms. With JWT, an attacker submitting the JWT
 token can choose the used signing algorithm. The PyJWT library requires
 that the application chooses what algorithms are supported. The application
 can specify `jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()` to get support for
 all algorithms, or specify a single algorithm. The issue is not that big as
 `algorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()` has to be used. Users
 should upgrade to v2.4.0 to receive a patch for this issue. As a
 workaround, always be explicit with the algorithms that are accepted and
 expected when decoding.

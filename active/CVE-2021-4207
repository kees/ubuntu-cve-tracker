Description:
 A flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in QEMU. A double
 fetch of guest controlled values `cursor->header.width` and
 `cursor->header.height` can lead to the allocation of a small cursor object
 followed by a subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. A malicious privileged
 guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host or
 potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.

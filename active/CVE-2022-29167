Description:
 Hawk is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making
 authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the
 request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host, and
 optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to parse
 `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular
 expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's
 input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was
 patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead.
 `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host`
 and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.

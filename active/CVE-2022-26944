 https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXB-2722
Description:
 Percona XtraBackup 2.4.20 unintentionally writes the command line to any
 resulting backup file output. This may include sensitive arguments passed
 at run time. In addition, when --history is passed at run time, this
 command line is also written to the PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history
 table. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2020-10997.

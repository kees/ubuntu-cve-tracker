Description:
 An issue was discovered in LemonLDAP::NG before 2.16.1. Weak session ID
 generation in the AuthBasic handler and incorrect failure handling during a
 password check allow attackers to bypass 2FA verification. Any plugin that
 tries to deny session creation after the store step does not deny an
 AuthBasic session.

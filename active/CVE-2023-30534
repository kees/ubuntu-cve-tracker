Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. There are two instances of insecure deserialization in Cacti
 version 1.2.24. While a viable gadget chain exists in Cacti’s vendor
 directory (phpseclib), the necessary gadgets are not included, making them
 inaccessible and the insecure deserializations not exploitable. Each
 instance of insecure deserialization is due to using the unserialize
 function without sanitizing the user input. Cacti has a “safe”
 deserialization that attempts to sanitize the content and check for
 specific values before calling unserialize, but it isn’t used in these
 instances. The vulnerable code lies in graphs_new.php, specifically within
 the host_new_graphs_save function. This issue has been addressed in version
 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
 this vulnerability.

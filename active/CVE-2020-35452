Description:
 Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted Digest
 nonce can cause a stack overflow in mod_auth_digest. There is no report of
 this overflow being exploitable, nor the Apache HTTP Server team could
 create one, though some particular compiler and/or compilation option might
 make it possible, with limited consequences anyway due to the size (a
 single byte) and the value (zero byte) of the overflow

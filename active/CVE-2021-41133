Description:
 Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed
 desktop applications on Linux. In versions prior to 1.10.4 and 1.12.0,
 Flatpak apps with direct access to AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by
 Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can trick portals and other host-OS
 services into treating the Flatpak app as though it was an ordinary,
 non-sandboxed host-OS process. They can do this by manipulating the VFS
 using recent mount-related syscalls that are not blocked by Flatpak's
 denylist seccomp filter, in order to substitute a crafted `/.flatpak-info`
 or make that file disappear entirely. Flatpak apps that act as clients for
 AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse
 can escalate the privileges that the corresponding services will believe
 the Flatpak app has. Note that protocols that operate entirely over the
 D-Bus session bus (user bus), system bus or accessibility bus are not
 affected by this. This is due to the use of a proxy process
 `xdg-dbus-proxy`, whose VFS cannot be manipulated by the Flatpak app, when
 interacting with these buses. Patches exist for versions 1.10.4 and 1.12.0,
 and as of time of publication, a patch for version 1.8.2 is being planned.
 There are no workarounds aside from upgrading to a patched version.

Description:
 A flaw was found in cobbler. This flaw lies in the generate_script
 RPC method, which accepts unsanitized parameters. This flaw allows an
 attacker to read arbitrary files on the system as root. Further, the
 attacker could gain arbitrary code execution using template injection
 against the default Cheetah template engine, leading to the exposure
 of sensitive information or execution of arbitrary code. The highest
 threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.

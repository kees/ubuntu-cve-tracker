Description:
 A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the megasas-gen2 SCSI host bus
 adapter emulation of QEMU in versions before and including 6.0. This issue
 occurs in the megasas_command_cancelled() callback function while dropping
 a SCSI request. This flaw allows a privileged guest user to crash the QEMU
 process on the host, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat
 from this vulnerability is to system availability.

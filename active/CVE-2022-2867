Description:
 libtiff's tiffcrop utility has a uint32_t underflow that can lead to out of
 bounds read and write. An attacker who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop
 (likely via tricking a user to run tiffcrop on it with certain parameters)
 could cause a crash or in some cases, further exploitation.

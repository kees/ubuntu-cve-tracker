Notes:
 ccdm94> in issue 704, which references this CVE, there is mention of
 ccdm94> commit d26481f24bd, which seems to be the one to fix this issue.
 ccdm94> This commit, however, was not merged by upstream. The code has
 ccdm94> changed to something that is similar to what is proposed in the
 ccdm94> previously mentioned non-merged commit, and the commit that did
 ccdm94> this was 563bd8499, which is very large. Applying the entire
 ccdm94> commit could result in a regression due to it being very big.
 ccdm94> There is no confirmation by upstream, however, that commit
 ccdm94> 563bd8499 is the one that fixes the issue.

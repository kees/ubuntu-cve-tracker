Description:
 In pygments 1.1+, fixed in 2.7.4, the lexers used to parse programming
 languages rely heavily on regular expressions. Some of the regular
 expressions have exponential or cubic worst-case complexity and are
 vulnerable to ReDoS. By crafting malicious input, an attacker can cause a
 denial of service.

Description:
 CarrierWave is a solution for file uploads for Rails, Sinatra and other
 Ruby web frameworks. CarrierWave has a Content-Type allowlist bypass
 vulnerability, possibly leading to XSS. The validation in
 `allowlisted_content_type?` determines Content-Type permissions by
 performing a partial match. If the `content_type` argument of
 `allowlisted_content_type?` is passed a value crafted by the attacker,
 Content-Types not included in the `content_type_allowlist` will be allowed.
 This issue has been patched in versions 2.2.5 and 3.0.5.

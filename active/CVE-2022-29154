Description:
 An issue was discovered in rsync before 3.2.5 that allows malicious remote
 servers to write arbitrary files inside the directories of connecting
 peers. The server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client.
 However, the rsync client performs insufficient validation of file names. A
 malicious rsync server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite
 arbitrary files in the rsync client target directory and subdirectories
 (for example, overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).

Description:
 Several memory leaks were found in the virtio vhost-user GPU device
 (vhost-user-gpu) of QEMU in versions up to and including 6.0. They exist in
 contrib/vhost-user-gpu/vhost-user-gpu.c and contrib/vhost-user-gpu/virgl.c
 due to improper release of memory (i.e., free) after effective lifetime.

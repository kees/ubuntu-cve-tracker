Description:
 xmldom is a pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core)
 `DOMParser` and `XMLSerializer` module. xmldom parses XML that is not
 well-formed because it contains multiple top level elements, and adds all
 root nodes to the `childNodes` collection of the `Document`, without
 reporting any error or throwing. This breaks the assumption that there is
 only a single root node in the tree, which led to issuance of
 CVE-2022-39299 as it is a potential issue for dependents. Update to
 @xmldom/xmldom@~0.7.7, @xmldom/xmldom@~0.8.4 (dist-tag latest) or
 @xmldom/xmldom@>=0.9.0-beta.4 (dist-tag next). As a workaround, please one
 of the following approaches depending on your use case: instead of
 searching for elements in the whole DOM, only search in the
 `documentElement`or reject a document with a document that has more then 1
 `childNode`.

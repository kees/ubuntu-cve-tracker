Description:
 An issue was discovered in Dropbear through 2020.81. Due to a
 non-RFC-compliant check of the available authentication methods in the
 client-side SSH code, it is possible for an SSH server to change the login
 process in its favor. This attack can bypass additional security measures
 such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass. Thus, it allows an attacker to abuse a
 forwarded agent for logging on to another server unnoticed.

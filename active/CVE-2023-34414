Description:
 The error page for sites with invalid TLS certificates was missing the
 activation-delay Firefox uses to protect prompts and permission dialogs
 from attacks that exploit human response time delays. If a malicious page
 elicited user clicks in precise locations immediately before navigating to
 a site with a certificate error and made the renderer extremely busy at the
 same time, it could create a gap between when the error page was loaded and
 when the display actually refreshed. With the right timing the elicited
 clicks could land in that gap and activate the button that overrides the
 certificate error for that site. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
 102.12, Firefox < 114, and Thunderbird < 102.12.

Description:
 Node.js depends on multiple built-in utility functions to normalize paths
 provided to node:fs functions, which can be overwitten with user-defined
 implementations leading to filesystem permission model bypass through path
 traversal attack.
 This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission
 model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 21.
 Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is
 an experimental feature of Node.js.

Description:
 GNU cpio through 2.13 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
 crafted pattern file, because of a dstring.c ds_fgetstr integer overflow
 that triggers an out-of-bounds heap write. NOTE: it is unclear whether
 there are common cases where the pattern file, associated with the -E
 option, is untrusted data.

 mdeslaur> second commit fixes a regression. There seems to still be a
 mdeslaur> regression even with the second commit as it is causing the
 mdeslaur> kernel to FTBFS.
 mdeslaur> Also see debian bugs for regressions.

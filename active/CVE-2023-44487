 mdeslaur> The nginx developers do not consider nginx to be affected by
 mdeslaur> this issue due to the default configuration restricting the
 mdeslaur> number of requests per connectiong (keepalive_requests). They
 mdeslaur> did provide a patch to harden nginx even further in environments
 mdeslaur> where the default are substantially modified.
 mdeslaur>

Description:
 The caml_ba_deserialize function in byterun/bigarray.c in the standard
 library in OCaml 4.06.0 has an integer overflow which, in situations where
 marshalled data is accepted from an untrusted source, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted object.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that OCaml mishandled crafted input. An attacker could use
 this vulnerability to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
 code.
Notes:
 msalvatore> binaries built with ocamlopt will need to be rebuilt after a system upgrade

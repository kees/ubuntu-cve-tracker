Description:
 An issue was found with how API keys are created with the Fleet-Server
 service account. When an API key is created with a service account, it is
 possible that the API key could be created with higher privileges than
 intended. Using this vulnerability, a compromised Fleet-Server service
 account could escalate themselves to a super-user.

Description:
 In Python (aka CPython) through 3.10.4, the mailcap module does not add
 escape characters into commands discovered in the system mailcap file. This
 may allow attackers to inject shell commands into applications that call
 mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack validation of
 user-provided filenames or arguments).

Description:
 An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.26, 3.2 before 3.2.11, and
 4.0 before 4.0.1. Due to leveraging the Django Template Language's variable
 resolution logic, the dictsort template filter was potentially vulnerable
 to information disclosure, or an unintended method call, if passed a
 suitably crafted key.

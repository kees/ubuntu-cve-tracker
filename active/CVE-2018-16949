Description:
 An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2.
 Several data types used as RPC input variables were implemented as
 unbounded array types, limited only by the inherent 32-bit length field to
 4 GB. An unauthenticated attacker could send, or claim to send, large input
 values and consume server resources waiting for those inputs, denying
 service to other valid connections.

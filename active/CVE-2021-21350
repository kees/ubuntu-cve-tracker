Description:
 XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In
 XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a
 remote attacker to execute arbitrary code only by manipulating the
 processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the
 recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist
 limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default
 blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version
 1.4.16.

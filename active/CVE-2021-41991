Description:
 The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote
 integer overflow upon receiving many requests with different certificates
 to fill the cache and later trigger the replacement of cache entries. The
 code attempts to select a less-often-used cache entry by means of a random
 number generator, but this is not done correctly. Remote code execution
 might be a slight possibility.

Description:
 The signature header is not signed, but some data is extracted from it and
 incorporated into the RPM database.  It may be possible to insert an
 erroneous and/or malicious OpenPGP signature into a signed package this
 way. It is possible to inject strings into the RPM database that the owner
 of the database would not wish it to contain.

Description:
 UltraJSON is a fast JSON encoder and decoder written in pure C with
 bindings for Python 3.7+. Affected versions were found to improperly decode
 certain characters. JSON strings that contain escaped surrogate characters
 not part of a proper surrogate pair were decoded incorrectly. Besides
 corrupting strings, this allowed for potential key confusion and value
 overwriting in dictionaries. All users parsing JSON from untrusted sources
 are vulnerable. From version 5.4.0, UltraJSON decodes lone surrogates in
 the same way as the standard library's `json` module does, preserving them
 in the parsed output. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
 workarounds for this issue.

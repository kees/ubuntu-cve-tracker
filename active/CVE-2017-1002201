Description:
 In haml versions prior to version 5.0.0.beta.2, when using user input to
 perform tasks on the server, characters like < > " ' must be escaped
 properly. In this case, the ' character was missed. An attacker can
 manipulate the input to introduce additional attributes, potentially
 executing code.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Haml did not properly escape the ' character. If Haml
 were made to process crafted data, an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

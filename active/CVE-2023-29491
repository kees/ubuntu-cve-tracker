Description:
 ncurses before 6.4 20230408, when used by a setuid application, allows

 data in a terminfo database file that is found in $HOME/.terminfo or
 reached via the TERMINFO or TERM environment variable.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> upstream commit has miscellaneous changes besides the
   security fix.
 mdeslaur> TODO: investigate why ncurses is built without
 mdeslaur> "with_root_environ=no" build option, that should be the default
 mdeslaur> going forward to prevent these types of issues.

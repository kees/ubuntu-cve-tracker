Description:
 An issue was discovered in Avira Phantom VPN through 2.23.1 for macOS. The
 VPN client insecurely configures the operating system such that all IP
 traffic to the VPN server's IP address is sent in plaintext outside the VPN
 tunnel, even if this traffic is not generated by the VPN client, while
 simultaneously using plaintext DNS to look up the VPN server's IP address.
 This allows an adversary to trick the victim into sending traffic to
 arbitrary IP addresses in plaintext outside the VPN tunnel. NOTE: the
 tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website uses this CVE ID to refer more
 generally to "ServerIP attack, combined with DNS spoofing, that can leak
 traffic to an arbitrary IP address" rather than to only Avira Phantom VPN.

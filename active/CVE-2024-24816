Description:
 CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. A
 cross-site scripting vulnerability vulnerability has been discovered in
 versions prior to 4.24.0-lts in samples that use the `preview` feature. All
 integrators that use these samples in the production code can be affected.
 The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute JavaScript code by abusing
 the misconfigured preview feature. It affects all users using the CKEditor
 4 at version < 4.24.0-lts with affected samples used in a production
 environment. A fix is available in version 4.24.0-lts.

Description:
 An issue was discovered in the function expr6 in eval.c in Netwide
 Assembler (NASM) through 2.14.02. There is a stack exhaustion problem
 caused by the expr6 function making recursive calls to itself in certain
 scenarios involving lots of '!' or '+' or '-' characters. Remote attackers
 could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via a
 crafted asm file.

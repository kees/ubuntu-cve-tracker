Description:
 An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking
 implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the bootp_input() function and
 could occur while processing a udp packet that is smaller than the size of
 the 'bootp_t' structure. A malicious guest could use this flaw to leak 10
 bytes of uninitialized heap memory from the host. The highest threat from
 this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects libslirp
 versions prior to 4.6.0.

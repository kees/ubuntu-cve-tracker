Description:
 [When relying on the `--local` clone optimization, Git dereferences
 symbolic links in the source repository before creating hardlinks (or
 copies) of the dereferenced link in the destination repository.  This can
 lead to surprising behavior where arbitrary files are present in a
 repository's `$GIT_DIR` when cloning from a malicious repository.]

Description:
 lxc-user-nic in lxc through 5.0.1 is installed setuid root, and may allow
 local users to infer whether any file exists, even within a protected
 directory tree, because "Failed to open" often indicates that a file does
 not exist, whereas "does not refer to a network namespace path" often
 indicates that a file exists. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2018-6556
 because the CVE-2018-6556 fix design was based on the premise that "we will
 report back to the user that the open() failed but the user has no way of
 knowing why it failed"; however, in many realistic cases, there are no
 plausible reasons for failing except that the file does not exist.

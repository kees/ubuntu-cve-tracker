Description:
 The broker in Eclipse Mosquitto 1.3.2 through 2.x before 2.0.16 has a
 memory leak that can be abused remotely when a client sends many QoS 2
 messages with duplicate message IDs, and fails to respond to PUBREC
 commands. This occurs because of mishandling of EAGAIN from the libc send
 function.

Description:
 Multiple path traversal vulnerabilities exist in smbserver.py in Impacket
 through 0.9.22. An attacker that connects to a running smbserver instance
 can list and write to arbitrary files via ../ directory traversal. This
 could potentially be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution by
 replacing /etc/shadow or an SSH authorized key.

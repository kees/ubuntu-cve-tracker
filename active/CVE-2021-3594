Description:
 An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking
 implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the udp_input() function and
 could occur while processing a udp packet that is smaller than the size of
 the 'udphdr' structure. This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or
 indirect host memory disclosure to the guest. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects libslirp
 versions prior to 4.6.0.

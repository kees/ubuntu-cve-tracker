Description:
 A use-after-free flaw was found in D-Bus Development branch <= 1.13.16,
 dbus-1.12.x stable branch <= 1.12.18, and dbus-1.10.x and older branches <=
 1.10.30 when a system has multiple usernames sharing the same UID. When a
 set of policy rules references these usernames, D-Bus may free some memory
 in the heap, which is still used by data structures necessary for the other
 usernames sharing the UID, possibly leading to a crash or other undefined
 behaviors

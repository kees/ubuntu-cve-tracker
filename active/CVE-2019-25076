Description:
 The TSS (Tuple Space Search) algorithm in Open vSwitch 2.x through 2.17.2
 and 3.0.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (delays of
 legitimate traffic) via crafted packet data that requires excessive
 evaluation time within the packet classification algorithm for the MegaFlow
 cache, aka a Tuple Space Explosion (TSE) attack.

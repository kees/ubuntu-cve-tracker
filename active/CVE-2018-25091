Description:
 urllib3 before 1.24.2 does not remove the authorization HTTP header when
 following a cross-origin redirect (i.e., a redirect that differs in host,
 port, or scheme). This can allow for credentials in the authorization
 header to be exposed to unintended hosts or transmitted in cleartext. NOTE:
 this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20060 (which
 was case-sensitive).
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> On focal and earlier, the python-pip package bundles
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3 binaries when built. After updating
 mdeslaur> python-urllib3, a no-change rebuild of python-pip is required.
 mdeslaur> On jammy and later, python-urllib3 is bundled in the python-pip
 mdeslaur> package and needs to be patched.
 sbeattie> According to Debian, this issue exists because of an
   incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20060 (which was case-sensitive)

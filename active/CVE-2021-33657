 https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/8c91cf7dba5193f5ce12d06db1336515851c9ee9 (release-2.0.20)
Description:
 There is a heap overflow problem in video/SDL_pixels.c in SDL (Simple
 DirectMedia Layer) 2.x to 2.0.18 versions. By crafting a malicious .BMP
 file, an attacker can cause the application using this library to crash,
 denial of service or Code execution.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 rodrigo-zaiden> The POC from the SDL issue link only reproduces in versions
 rodrigo-zaiden> 2.0.16 and 2.0.18 because of the following commit
 rodrigo-zaiden>   https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/fed84650
 rodrigo-zaiden> In older versions of libsdl2 and also libsdl1.2, even though
 rodrigo-zaiden> the commit above is not present, I think that there might be a
 rodrigo-zaiden> slight chance to trick the lib with a special crafted input to
 rodrigo-zaiden> cause the heap overflow, and patching will not cause any harm.

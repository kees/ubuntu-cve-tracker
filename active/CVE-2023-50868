Description:
 The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC
 9276 guidance is skipped) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC responses in a
 random subdomain attack, aka the "NSEC3" issue. The RFC 5155 specification
 implies that an algorithm must perform thousands of iterations of a hash
 function in certain situations.

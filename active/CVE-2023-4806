Description:
 A flaw was found in glibc. In an extremely rare situation, the getaddrinfo
 function may access memory that has been freed, resulting in an application
 crash. This issue is only exploitable when a NSS module implements only the
 _nss_*_gethostbyname2_r and _nss_*_getcanonname_r hooks without
 implementing the _nss_*_gethostbyname3_r hook. The resolved name should
 return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo
 function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL
 and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.

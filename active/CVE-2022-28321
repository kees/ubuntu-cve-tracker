Description:
 The Linux-PAM package before 1.5.2-6.1 for openSUSE Tumbleweed allows
 authentication bypass for SSH logins. The pam_access.so module doesn't
 correctly restrict login if a user tries to connect from an IP address that
 is not resolvable via DNS. In such conditions, a user with denied access to
 a machine can still get access. NOTE: the relevance of this issue is
 largely limited to openSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE Factory; it does not
 affect Linux-PAM upstream.

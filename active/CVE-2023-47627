Description:
 aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and
 Python. The HTTP parser in AIOHTTP has numerous problems with header
 parsing, which could lead to request smuggling. This parser is only used
 when AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled (or not using a prebuilt wheel).
 These bugs have been addressed in commit `d5c12ba89` which has been
 included in release version 3.8.6. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
 no known workarounds for these issues.

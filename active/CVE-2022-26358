Description:
 IOMMU: RMRR (VT-d) and unity map (AMD-Vi) handling issues T[his CNA
 information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which
 aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Certain PCI devices in a
 system might be assigned Reserved Memory Regions (specified via Reserved
 Memory Region Reporting, "RMRR") for Intel VT-d or Unity Mapping ranges for
 AMD-Vi. These are typically used for platform tasks such as legacy USB
 emulation. Since the precise purpose of these regions is unknown, once a
 device associated with such a region is active, the mappings of these
 regions need to remain continuouly accessible by the device. This
 requirement has been violated. Subsequent DMA or interrupts from the device
 may have unpredictable behaviour, ranging from IOMMU faults to memory
 corruption.

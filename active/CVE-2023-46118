Description:
 RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging and streaming broker. HTTP API did
 not enforce an HTTP request body limit, making it vulnerable for denial of
 service (DoS) attacks with very large messages. An authenticated user with
 sufficient credentials can publish a very large messages over the HTTP API
 and cause target node to be terminated by an "out-of-memory killer"-like
 mechanism. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 3.11.24 and
 3.12.7.

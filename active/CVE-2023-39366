Description:
 Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
 framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting
 (XSS) Vulnerability allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in
 the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_
 accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time.
 The `data_sources.php` script displays the data source management
 information (e.g. data source path, polling configuration etc.) for
 different data visualizations of the _cacti_ app. CENSUS found that an
 adversary that is able to configure a malicious Device name, can deploy a
 stored XSS attack against any user of the same (or broader) privileges. A
 user that possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_
 permissions can configure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration
 occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious
 payload is exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`. This
 vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to
 upgrade. Users unable to update should manually filter HTML output.

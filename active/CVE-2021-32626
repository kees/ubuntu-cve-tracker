Description:
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In
 affected versions specially crafted Lua scripts executing in Redis can
 cause the heap-based Lua stack to be overflowed, due to incomplete checks
 for this condition. This can result with heap corruption and potentially
 remote code execution. This problem exists in all versions of Redis with
 Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6. The problem is fixed in versions
 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users unable to update an additional
 workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server
 executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done
 using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.

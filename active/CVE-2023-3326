Description:
 pam_krb5 authenticates a user by essentially running kinit with the
 password, getting a ticket-granting ticket (tgt) from the Kerberos KDC (Key
 Distribution Center) over the network, as a way to verify the password.
 However, if a keytab is not provisioned on the system, pam_krb5 has no way
 to validate the response from the KDC, and essentially trusts the tgt
 provided over the network as being valid. In a non-default FreeBSD
 installation that leverages pam_krb5 for authentication and does not have a
 keytab provisioned, an attacker that is able to control both the password
 and the KDC responses can return a valid tgt, allowing authentication to
 occur for any user on the system.

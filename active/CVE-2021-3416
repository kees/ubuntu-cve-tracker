 A potential stack overflow via infinite loop issue was found in various NIC
 emulators of QEMU in versions up to and including 5.2.0. The issue occurs
 in loopback mode of a NIC wherein reentrant DMA checks get bypassed. A
 guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles or crash the
 QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.

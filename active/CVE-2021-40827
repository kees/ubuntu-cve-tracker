Description:
 Clementine Music Player through 1.3.1 (when a GLib 2.0.0 DLL is used) is
 vulnerable to a Read Access Violation on Block Data Move, affecting the MP3
 file parsing functionality at memcpy+0x265. The vulnerability is triggered
 when the user opens a crafted MP3 file or loads a remote stream URL that is
 mishandled by Clementine. Attackers could exploit this issue to cause a
 crash (DoS) of the clementine.exe process or achieve arbitrary code
 execution in the context of the current logged-in Windows user.

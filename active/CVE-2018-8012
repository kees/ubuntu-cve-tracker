Description:
 No authentication/authorization is enforced when a server attempts to join
 a quorum in Apache ZooKeeper before 3.4.10, and 3.5.0-alpha through
 3.5.3-beta. As a result an arbitrary end point could join the cluster and
 begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Apache Zookeeper incorrectly handled clusters. An 
 attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information.
Notes:
 msalvatore> Debian notes that for wheezy (3.4.5) the "changes are too intrusive
 msalvatore> to backport"

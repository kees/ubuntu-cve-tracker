Description:
 When using Apache Shiro before 1.11.0 together with Spring Boot 2.6+, a
 specially crafted HTTP request may cause an authentication bypass. The
 authentication bypass occurs when Shiro and Spring Boot are using different
 pattern-matching techniques. Both Shiro and Spring Boot < 2.6 default to
 Ant style pattern matching. Mitigation: Update to Apache Shiro 1.11.0, or
 set the following Spring Boot configuration value:
 `spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy = ant_path_matcher`

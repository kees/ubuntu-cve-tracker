Description:
 A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/quantum-export.c. An attacker
 who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
 undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type
 `unsigned long long` as well as a shift exponent that is too large for
 64-bit type. This would most likely lead to an impact to application
 availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to
 undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to
 7.0.9-0.

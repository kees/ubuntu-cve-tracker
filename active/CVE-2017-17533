Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** default.tcl in Tkabber 1.1 does not validate strings before
 launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which
 might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a
 crafted URL. NOTE: a third party has indicated that the attack cannot occur
 because of the argument-parsing behavior of the Tcl exec function.

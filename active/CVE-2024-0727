Description:
 Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead
 OpenSSL to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack Impact
 summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted
 sources might terminate abruptly. A file in PKCS12 format can contain
 certificates and keys and may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12
 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL does not
 correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference
 that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files
 from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will
 be vulnerable to this issue. OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are:
 PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(),
 PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and PKCS12_newpass(). We have also fixed a
 similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this function is
 related to writing data we do not consider it security significant. The
 FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

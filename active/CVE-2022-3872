Description:
 An off-by-one read/write issue was found in the SDHCI device of QEMU. It
 occurs when reading/writing the Buffer Data Port Register in
 sdhci_read_dataport and sdhci_write_dataport, respectively, if data_count
 == block_size. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU
 process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.

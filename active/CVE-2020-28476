Description:
 All versions of package tornado are vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning by
 using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attacker can separate
 query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the
 interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default
 configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being
 cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the
 semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key
 of an unkeyed parameter.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> per tornado developers, this isn't an issue in tornado itself,
 mdeslaur> but in the python standard library.
 mdeslaur> as of 2021-01-29, no details on possible fix from upstream

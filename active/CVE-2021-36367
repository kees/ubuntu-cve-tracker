Description:
 PuTTY through 0.75 proceeds with establishing an SSH session even if it has
 never sent a substantive authentication response. This makes it easier for
 an attacker-controlled SSH server to present a later spoofed authentication
 prompt (that the attacker can use to capture credential data, and use that
 data for purposes that are undesired by the client user).

Description:
 file.copy operations in GruntJS are vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition
 leading to arbitrary file write in GitHub repository gruntjs/grunt prior to
 1.5.3. This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary file writes which can
 lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS user if a
 lower-privileged user has write access to both source and destination
 directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink to the
 GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the GruntJS user
 is root.

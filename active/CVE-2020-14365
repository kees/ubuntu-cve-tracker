Description:
 A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine, in ansible-engine 2.8.x before
 2.8.15 and ansible-engine 2.9.x before 2.9.13, when installing packages
 using the dnf module. GPG signatures are ignored during installation even
 when disable_gpg_check is set to False, which is the default behavior. This
 flaw leads to malicious packages being installed on the system and
 arbitrary code executed via package installation scripts. The highest
 threat from this vulnerability is to integrity and system availability.

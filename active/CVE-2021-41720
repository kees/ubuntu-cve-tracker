Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** A command injection vulnerability in Lodash 4.17.21 allows
 attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution via the template function.
 This is a different parameter, method, and version than CVE-2021-23337.
 NOTE: the vendor's position is that it's the developer's responsibility to
 ensure that a template does not evaluate code that originates from
 untrusted input.

Description:
 A use-after-free flaw was found in PackageKitd. In some conditions, the
 order of cleanup mechanics for a transaction could be impacted. As a
 result, some memory access could occur on memory regions that were
 previously freed. Once freed, a memory region can be reused for other
 allocations and any previously stored data in this memory region is
 considered lost.

Description:
 Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in Address.pm in the Email-Address
 module 1.908 and earlier for Perl allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted string containing a list of
 e-mail addresses in conjunction with parenthesis characters that can be
 associated with nested comments. NOTE: the default configuration in 1.908
 mitigates this vulnerability but misparses certain realistic comments.

Description:
 Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex
 addresses one may unintentionally cause an overflow. Ironically this
 happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes
 negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user
 interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations.
 This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has been included
 in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
 known workarounds for this vulnerability.

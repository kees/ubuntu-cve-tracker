Description:
 Prior to ffmpeg version 4.3, the tty demuxer did not have a 'read_probe'
 function assigned to it. By crafting a legitimate "ffconcat" file that
 references an image, followed by a file the triggers the tty demuxer, the
 contents of the second file will be copied into the output file verbatim
 (as long as the `-vcodec copy` option is passed to ffmpeg).

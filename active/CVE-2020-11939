Description:
 In nDPI through 3.2 Stable, the SSH protocol dissector has multiple KEXINIT
 integer overflows that result in a controlled remote heap overflow in
 concat_hash_string in ssh.c. Due to the granular nature of the overflow
 primitive and the ability to control both the contents and layout of the
 nDPI library's heap memory through remote input, this vulnerability may be
 abused to achieve full Remote Code Execution against any network inspection
 stack that is linked against nDPI and uses it to perform network traffic
 analysis.

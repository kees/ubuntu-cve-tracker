Description:
 A path traversal vulnerability was found in the CPIO utility. This issue
 could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to trick a user into opening
 a specially crafted archive. During the extraction process, the archiver
 could follow symlinks outside of the intended directory, which could be
 utilized to run arbitrary commands on the target system.

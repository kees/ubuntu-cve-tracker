Description:
 jQuery-UI is the official jQuery user interface library. Prior to version
 1.13.0, accepting the value of the `of` option of the `.position()` util
 from untrusted sources may execute untrusted code. The issue is fixed in
 jQuery UI 1.13.0. Any string value passed to the `of` option is now treated
 as a CSS selector. A workaround is to not accept the value of the `of`
 option from untrusted sources.

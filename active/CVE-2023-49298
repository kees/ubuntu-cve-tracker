Description:
 OpenZFS through 2.1.13 and 2.2.x through 2.2.1, in certain scenarios
 involving applications that try to rely on efficient copying of file data,
 can replace file contents with zero-valued bytes and thus potentially
 disable security mechanisms. NOTE: this issue is not always security
 related, but can be security related in realistic situations. A possible
 example is cp, from a recent GNU Core Utilities (coreutils) version, when
 attempting to preserve a rule set for denying unauthorized access. (One
 might use cp when configuring access control, such as with the
 /etc/hosts.deny file specified in the IBM Support reference.) NOTE: this
 issue occurs less often in version 2.2.1, and in versions before 2.1.4,
 because of the default configuration in those versions.

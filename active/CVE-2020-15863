Description:
 hw/net/xgmac.c in the XGMAC Ethernet controller in QEMU before 07-20-2020
 has a buffer overflow. This occurs during packet transmission and affects
 the highbank and midway emulated machines. A guest user or process could
 use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial
 of service or potential privileged code execution. This was fixed in commit
 5519724a13664b43e225ca05351c60b4468e4555.

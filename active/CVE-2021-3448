Description:
 A flaw was found in dnsmasq in versions before 2.85. When configured to use
 a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port
 while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the
 outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission
 ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS
 Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to data integrity.

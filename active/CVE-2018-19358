Description:
 GNOME Keyring through 3.28.2 allows local users to retrieve login
 credentials via a Secret Service API call and the D-Bus interface if the
 keyring is unlocked, a similar issue to CVE-2008-7320. One perspective is
 that this occurs because available D-Bus protection mechanisms (involving
 the busconfig and policy XML elements) are not used.

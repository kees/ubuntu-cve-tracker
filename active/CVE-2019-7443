Description:
 KDE KAuth before 5.55 allows the passing of parameters with arbitrary types
 to helpers running as root over DBus via DBusHelperProxy.cpp. Certain types
 can cause crashes, and trigger the decoding of arbitrary images with
 dynamically loaded plugins. In other words, KAuth unintentionally causes
 this plugin code to run as root, which increases the severity of any
 possible exploitation of a plugin vulnerability.

Description:
 UltraJSON (aka ujson) through 5.1.0 has a stack-based buffer overflow in
 Buffer_AppendIndentUnchecked (called from encode). Exploitation can, for
 example, use a large amount of indentation.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> the embedded ujson code in pandas, eventhough containing similar
 ccdm94> content as the upstream ujson code, seems to have diverged from the
 ccdm94> ujson upstream project (they have fully forked ujson), since pandas
 ccdm94> upstream is maintaining their own ujson bug fixes and changes without
 ccdm94> re-syncing with the ujson upstream project. There is no indication
 ccdm94> the ujson fork, as used in pandas, is vulnerable to the same issues
 ccdm94> as the upstream ujson code.

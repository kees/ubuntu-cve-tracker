Description:
 The Noise protocol implementation suffers from weakened cryptographic
 security after encrypting 2^64 messages, and a potential denial of service
 attack. After 2^64 (~18.4 quintillion) messages are encrypted with the
 Encrypt function, the nonce counter will wrap around, causing multiple
 messages to be encrypted with the same key and nonce. In a separate issue,
 the Decrypt function increments the nonce state even when it fails to
 decrypt a message. If an attacker can provide an invalid input to the
 Decrypt function, this will cause the nonce state to desynchronize between
 the peers, resulting in a failure to encrypt all subsequent messages.

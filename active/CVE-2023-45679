Description:
 stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg vorbis
 files. A crafted file may trigger memory allocation failure in
 `start_decoder`. In that case the function returns early, but some of the
 pointers in `f->comment_list` are left initialized and later `setup_free`
 is called on these pointers in `vorbis_deinit`. This issue may lead to code
 execution.

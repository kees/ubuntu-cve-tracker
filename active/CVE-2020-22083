Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** jsonpickle through 1.4.1 allows remote code execution during
 deserialization of a malicious payload through the decode() function. Note:
 It has been argued that this is expected and clearly documented behaviour.
 pickle is known to be capable of causing arbitrary code execution, and must
 not be used with un-trusted data.

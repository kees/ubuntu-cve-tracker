Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The daemon in Tor through 0.4.1.8 and 0.4.2.x through
 0.4.2.6 does not verify that a rendezvous node is known before attempting
 to connect to it, which might make it easier for remote attackers to
 discover circuit information. NOTE: The network team of Tor claims this is
 an intended behavior and not a vulnerability.

Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Moodle 3.1.2 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information via unspecified vectors, related to a "SQL Injection" issue
 affecting the Administration panel function in the installation process
 component.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report, noting
 that "the person who is installing Moodle must know database access
 credentials and they can access the database directly; there is no need for
 them to create a SQL injection in one of the installation dialogue fields."

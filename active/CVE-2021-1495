Description:
 Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort
 detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
 bypass a configured file policy for HTTP. The vulnerability is due to
 incorrect handling of specific HTTP header parameters. An attacker could
 exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets through an
 affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a
 configured file policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload.

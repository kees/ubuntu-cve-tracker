Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** In LuaJIT through 2.0.5, as used in Moonjit before 2.1.2 and
 other products, debug.getinfo has a type confusion issue that leads to
 arbitrary memory write or read operations, because certain cases involving
 valid stack levels and > options are mishandled. NOTE: The LuaJIT project
 owner states that the debug libary is unsafe by definition and that this is
 not a vulnerability. When LuaJIT was originally developed, the expectation
 was that the entire debug library had no security guarantees and thus it
 made no sense to assign CVEs. However, not all users of later LuaJIT
 derivatives share this perspective.

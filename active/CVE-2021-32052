Description:
 In Django 2.2 before 2.2.22, 3.1 before 3.1.10, and 3.2 before 3.2.2 (with
 Python 3.9.5+), URLValidator does not prohibit newlines and tabs (unless
 the URLField form field is used). If an application uses values with
 newlines in an HTTP response, header injection can occur. Django itself is
 unaffected because HttpResponse prohibits newlines in HTTP headers.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 amurray| Requires Python 3.9.5 or greater which is only present in focal+
  (and only used as the default python interpreter in hirsute+ which means
  this is a low priority for python-django in focal and groovy)

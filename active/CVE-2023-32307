Description:
 Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent library, compliant with the IETF
 RFC3261 specification. Referring to
 [GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54](https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54),
 several other potential heap-over-flow and integer-overflow in
 stun_parse_attr_error_code and stun_parse_attr_uint32 were found because
 the lack of attributes length check when Sofia-SIP handles STUN packets.
 The previous patch of
 [GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54](https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54)
 fixed the vulnerability when attr_type did not match the enum value, but
 there are also vulnerabilities in the handling of other valid cases. The
 OOB read and integer-overflow made by attacker may lead to crash, high
 consumption of memory or even other more serious consequences. These issue
 have been addressed in version 1.13.15. Users are advised to upgrade.

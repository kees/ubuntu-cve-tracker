Description:
 fscrypt through v0.3.2 creates a world-writable directory by default when
 setting up a filesystem, allowing unprivileged users to exhaust filesystem
 space. We recommend upgrading to fscrypt 0.3.3 or above and adjusting the
 permissions on existing fscrypt metadata directories where applicable.

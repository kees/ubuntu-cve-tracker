Description:
 OpenSSH through 9.6, when common types of DRAM are used, might allow row
 hammer attacks (for authentication bypass) because the integer value of
 authenticated in mm_answer_authpassword does not resist flips of a single
 bit. NOTE: this is applicable to a certain threat model of attacker-victim
 co-location in which the attacker has user privileges.

Description:
 A crafted JPEG image may lead the JPEG reader to underflow its data pointer,
 allowing user controlled data to be written in heap. To be successfully
 performed the attacker needs to do some triage over the heap layout and craft
 an image with a malicious format and payload. This vulnerability can lead to
 data corruption and eventual code execution or secure boot circumvention

Description:
 LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g.
 users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions
 prior to 8.0 incorrect regular expressions allow to upload PHP scripts to
 config/templates/pdf. This vulnerability could lead to a Remote Code
 Execution if the /config/templates/pdf/ directory is accessible for remote
 users. This is not a default configuration of LAM. This issue has been
 fixed in version 8.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

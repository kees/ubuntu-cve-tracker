Description:
 A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Node.js 20 that allowed
 loading arbitrary OpenSSL engines when the experimental permission model is
 enabled, which can bypass and/or disable the permission model. The attack
 complexity is high. However, the crypto.setEngine() API can be used to
 bypass the permission model when called with a compatible OpenSSL engine.
 The OpenSSL engine can, for example, disable the permission model in the
 host process by manipulating the process's stack memory to locate the
 permission model Permission::enabled_ in the host process's heap memory.
 Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is
 an experimental feature of Node.js.

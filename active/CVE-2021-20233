Description:
 A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. Setparam_prefix() in
 the menu rendering code performs a length calculation on the assumption
 that expressing a quoted single quote will require 3 characters, while it
 actually requires 4 characters which allows an attacker to corrupt memory
 by one byte for each quote in the input. The highest threat from this
 vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system
 availability.

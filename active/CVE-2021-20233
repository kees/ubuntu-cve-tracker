Description:
 There's a flaw on grub2 menu rendering code setparam_prefix() in the menu
 rendering code performs a length calculation on the assumption that
 expressing a quoted single quote will require 3 characters, while it
 actually requires 4 characters. This allow an attacker to corrupt memory by
 one byte for each quote in the input.

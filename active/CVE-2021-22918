Description:
 An out-of-bound read can occur when uv__idna_toascii() is used to convert strings to ASCII.
 The pointer p is read and increased without checking whether it is beyond pe, with the latter
 holding a pointer to the end of the buffer. This can lead to information disclosures or crashes.
 This function can be triggered via uv_getaddrinfo().  nodejs seems to use libuv and is possibly affected by this as well.

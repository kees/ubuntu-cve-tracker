Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ccdm94> The patch for this issue is the same as the one for
 ccdm94> CVE-2016-9572 and CVE-2016-9573, if we consider commit
 ccdm94> a817832c223 (and pull request #895), which aims to fix
 ccdm94> more than one issue. The commit which fixes this CVE
 ccdm94> and CVE-2016-9581 only has been superseded by
 ccdm94> a817832c223.
 ccdm94> Commit a817832c223, which is related to pull request 895 was
 ccdm94> never merged, however, and instead, was broken down into 
 ccdm94> various other commits by upstream, and those were merged       
 ccdm94> instead.

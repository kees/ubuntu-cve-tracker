Description:
 Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the
 template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. It is possible to
 inject arbitrary HTML attributes into the rendered HTML template,
 potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The Jinja `xmlattr`
 filter can be abused to inject arbitrary HTML attribute keys and values,
 bypassing the auto escaping mechanism and potentially leading to XSS. It
 may also be possible to bypass attribute validation checks if they are
 blacklist-based.

Description:
 ares_inet_net_pton() is vulnerable to a buffer underflow for certain
 ipv6 addresses, in particular "0::00:00:00/2" was found to cause an
 issue. C-ares only uses this function internally for configuration
 purposes which would require an administrator to configure such an
 address via ares_set_sortlist().

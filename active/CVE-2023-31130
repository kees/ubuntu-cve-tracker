Description:
 c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. ares_inet_net_pton() is
 vulnerable to a buffer underflow for certain ipv6 addresses, in particular
 "0::00:00:00/2" was found to cause an issue. C-ares only uses this function
 internally for configuration purposes which would require an administrator
 to configure such an address via ares_set_sortlist(). However, users may
 externally use ares_inet_net_pton() for other purposes and thus be
 vulnerable to more severe issues. This issue has been fixed in 1.19.1.

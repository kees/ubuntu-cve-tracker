Description:
 An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS 2.x before 2.28.7 and 3.x before 3.5.2.
 There was a timing side channel in RSA private operations. This side
 channel could be sufficient for a local attacker to recover the plaintext.
 It requires the attacker to send a large number of messages for decryption,
 as described in "Everlasting ROBOT: the Marvin Attack" by Hubert Kario.

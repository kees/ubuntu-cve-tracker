Description:
 etcd is a distributed key-value store for the data of a distributed system.
 Prior to versions 3.4.26 and 3.5.9, the LeaseTimeToLive API allows access
 to key names (not value) associated to a lease when `Keys` parameter is
 true, even a user doesn't have read permission to the keys. The impact is
 limited to a cluster which enables auth (RBAC). Versions 3.4.26 and 3.5.9
 fix this issue. There are no known workarounds.

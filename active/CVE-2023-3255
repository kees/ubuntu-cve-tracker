Description:
 A flaw was found in the QEMU built-in VNC server while processing
 ClientCutText messages. A wrong exit condition may lead to an infinite loop
 when inflating an attacker controlled zlib buffer in the `inflate_buffer`
 function. This could allow a remote authenticated client who is able to
 send a clipboard to the VNC server to trigger a denial of service.

Description:
 A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in qs up to 6.8.0 due to
 insufficient sanitization of property in the gs.parse function. The merge()
 function allows the assignment of properties on an array in the query. For
 any property being assigned, a value in the array is converted to an object
 containing these properties. Essentially, this means that the property
 whose expected type is Array always has to be checked with Array.isArray()
 by the user. This may not be obvious to the user and can cause unexpected
 behavior.

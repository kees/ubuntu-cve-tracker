Description:
 systemd before 247 does not adequately block local privilege escalation for
 some Sudo configurations, e.g., plausible sudoers files in which the
 "systemctl status" command may be executed. Specifically, systemd does not
 set LESSSECURE to 1, and thus other programs may be launched from the less
 program. This presents a substantial security risk when running systemctl
 from Sudo, because less executes as root when the terminal size is too
 small to show the complete systemctl output.

Description:
 XScreenSaver 5.45 can be bypassed if the machine has more than ten
 disconnectable video outputs. A buffer overflow in update_screen_layout()
 allows an attacker to bypass the standard screen lock authentication
 mechanism by crashing XScreenSaver. The attacker must physically disconnect
 many video outputs.

Description:
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An
 integer overflow bug affecting all versions of Redis can be exploited to
 corrupt the heap and potentially be used to leak arbitrary contents of the
 heap or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing
 the default set-max-intset-entries configuration parameter to a very large
 value and constructing specially crafted commands to manipulate sets. The
 problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional
 workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server
 executable is to prevent users from modifying the set-max-intset-entries
 configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict
 unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.

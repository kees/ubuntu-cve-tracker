Description:
 Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs
 present in Firefox 93 and Firefox ESR 91.2. Some of these bugs showed
 evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some
 of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
 vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR <
 91.3.

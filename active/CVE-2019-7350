Description:
 Session fixation exists in ZoneMinder through 1.32.3, as an attacker can
 fixate his own session cookies to the next logged-in user, thereby
 hijacking the victim's account. This occurs because a set of multiple
 cookies (between 3 and 5) is being generated when a user successfully logs
 in, and these sets overlap for successive logins.

Description:
 jQuery-UI is the official jQuery user interface library. Prior to version
 1.13.0, accepting the value of various `*Text` options of the Datepicker
 widget from untrusted sources may execute untrusted code. The issue is
 fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0. The values passed to various `*Text` options are
 now always treated as pure text, not HTML. A workaround is to not accept
 the value of the `*Text` options from untrusted sources.

Description:
 Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
 deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The assertion failure
 is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata of a crafted image
 file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a
 denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a
 crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when modifying the
 metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the
 metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line
 application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fi`.
 ### Patches The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5. ### References Regression
 test and bug fix: #1739 ### For more information Please see our [security
 policy](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/policy) for information

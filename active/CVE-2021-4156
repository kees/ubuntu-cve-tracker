Description:
 An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in libsndfile's FLAC codec
 functionality. An attacker who is able to submit a specially crafted file
 (via tricking a user to open or otherwise) to an application linked with
 libsndfile and using the FLAC codec, could trigger an out-of-bounds read
 that would most likely cause a crash but could potentially leak memory
 information that could be used in further exploitation of other flaws.

Description:
 grub_usb_device_initialize() is called to handle USB device
 initialization. it reads out the descriptors it needs from the USB device
 and uses that data to fill in some USB data
 structures. grub_usb_device_initialize() performs very little bounds
 checking and simply assumes the USB device provides sane values. This
 behavior can trigger memory corruption. If properly exploited, this would
 lead to arbitrary code execution allowing the attacker to by-pass
 SecureBoot mechanism.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 sbeattie| Ubuntu packaging does not include the usb module in the
   signed EFI grub artifacts, so is not affected.
 sbeattie| grub2-unsigned will contain fixes and supersede grub2, which
  will contain only BIOS grub bits.

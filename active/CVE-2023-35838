Description:
 The WireGuard client 0.5.3 on Windows insecurely configures the operating
 system and firewall such that traffic to a local network that uses
 non-RFC1918 IP addresses is blocked. This allows an adversary to trick the
 victim into blocking IP traffic to selected IP addresses and services even
 while the VPN is enabled. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website
 uses this CVE ID to refer more generally to "LocalNet attack resulting in
 the blocking of traffic" rather than to only WireGuard.

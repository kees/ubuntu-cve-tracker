Description:
 A vulnerability in the SSL/TLS certificate handling of Snort 3 Detection
 Engine integration with Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could
 allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Snort 3 detection
 engine to restart. This vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs
 when an SSL/TLS certificate that is under load is accessed when it is
 initiating an SSL connection. Under specific, time-based constraints, an
 attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of SSL/TLS
 connection requests to be inspected by the Snort 3 detection engine on an
 affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the
 Snort 3 detection engine to reload, resulting in either a bypass or a
 denial of service (DoS) condition, depending on device configuration. The
 Snort detection engine will restart automatically. No manual intervention
 is required.

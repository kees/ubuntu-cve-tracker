Description:
 The Java OpenWire protocol marshaller is vulnerable to Remote Code
 Execution. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker with network
 access to either a Java-based OpenWire broker or client to run arbitrary
 shell commands by manipulating serialized class types in the OpenWire
 protocol to cause either the client or the broker (respectively) to
 instantiate any class on the classpath. Users are recommended to upgrade
 both brokers and clients to version 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, or 5.18.3
 which fixes this issue.

Description:
 Reader.Read does not set a limit on the maximum size of file headers. A
 maliciously crafted archive could cause Read to allocate unbounded amounts
 of memory, potentially causing resource exhaustion or panics. After fix,
 Reader.Read limits the maximum size of header blocks to 1 MiB.

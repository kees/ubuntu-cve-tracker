Description:
 GRUB2 enables the use of the command acpi even when secure boot is signaled
 by the firmware. An attacker with local root privileges to can drop a small
 SSDT in /boot/efi and modify grub.cfg to instruct grub to load said SSDT.
 The SSDT then gets run by the kernel and it overwrites the kernel lockdown
 configuration enabling the attacker to load unsigned kernel modules and
 kexec unsigned code.

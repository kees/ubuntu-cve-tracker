Description:
 Libarchive through 3.6.2 can cause directories to have world-writable
 permissions. The umask() call inside archive_write_disk_posix.c changes the
 umask of the whole process for a very short period of time; a race
 condition with another thread can lead to a permanent umask 0 setting. Such
 a race condition could lead to implicit directory creation with permissions
 0777 (without the sticky bit), which means that any low-privileged local
 user can delete and rename files inside those directories.

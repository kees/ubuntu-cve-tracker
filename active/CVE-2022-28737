Description:
 There's a possible overflow in handle_image() when shim tries to load and execute
 crafted EFI executables; The handle_image() function takes into account the SizeOfRawData
 field from each section to be loaded. An attacker can leverage this to perform
 out-of-bound writes into memory. Arbitrary code execution is not discarded in
 such scenario.

Description:
 UltraJSON is a fast JSON encoder and decoder written in pure C with
 bindings for Python 3.7+. In versions prior to 5.4.0 an error occurring
 while reallocating a buffer for string decoding can cause the buffer to get
 freed twice. Due to how UltraJSON uses the internal decoder, this double
 free is impossible to trigger from Python. This issue has been resolved in
 version 5.4.0 and all users should upgrade to UltraJSON 5.4.0. There are no
 known workarounds for this issue.

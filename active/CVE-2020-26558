Description:
 Bluetooth LE and BR/EDR secure pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 2.1
 through 5.2 may permit a nearby man-in-the-middle attacker to identify the
 Passkey used during pairing (in the Passkey authentication procedure) by
 reflection of the public key and the authentication evidence of the
 initiating device, potentially permitting this attacker to complete
 authenticated pairing with the responding device using the correct Passkey
 for the pairing session. The attack methodology determines the Passkey
 value one bit at a time.

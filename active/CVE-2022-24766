Description:
 mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In
 mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform
 HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a
 malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy
 as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy
 would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests.
 A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but
 it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual
 mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access
 control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect
 an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed
 in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

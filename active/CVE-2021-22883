Description:
 Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to a
 denial of service attack when too many connection attempts with an
 'unknownProtocol' are established. This leads to a leak of file
 descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the system, then
 the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also
 from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then
 this lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the system to run out of
 memory.

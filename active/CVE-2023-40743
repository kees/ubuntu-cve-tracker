Description:
 ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** When integrating Apache Axis 1.x in an
 application, it may not have been obvious that looking up a service through
 "ServiceFactory.getService" allows potentially dangerous lookup mechanisms
 such as LDAP. When passing untrusted input to this API method, this could
 expose the application to DoS, SSRF and even attacks leading to RCE. As
 Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine,
 such as Apache Axis 2/Java. As a workaround, you may review your code to
 verify no untrusted or unsanitized input is passed to
 "ServiceFactory.getService", or by applying the patch from
 https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210
 . The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release
 fixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards
 this are welcome.

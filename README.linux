Distro kernels
--------------
Ubuntu kernels as part of the archive are listed here:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Dev/ABIPackages

Android kernels (flo, goldfish, grouper, maguro, mako and manta) are not
supported on the Ubuntu Touch 14.10 and earlier preview kernels.

LTS backport kernels from interim releases are typically not supported once the
next LTS backprt kernel is available. For example, now that linux-lts-trusty
is available, linux-lts-quantal and linux-lts-saucy no longer receive official
support.

# Based on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/kernel-sru-workflow
# this script implements the security team's first step of:
#
# "When the security team detects that the Security-signoff task is in
# the ready-to-start state (status: Confirmed), they change the tasks
# state to in-progress (status: In Progress). The task is reassigned
# to the individual working the task."
#
# The rest of the procedure is done manually:
#
# "They take care of any tasks they deem necessary prior to having an
# archive admin copy the release to the security pocket. If there are no
# CVEs, the security team sets the Security-signoff task to the not-needed
# state (status: Invalid). If there are CVEs in the release and the security
# team has signed-off on the release being promoted to the security pocket
# (once all testing passes successfully) they change the status of the
# Security-signoff task to completed (status: Fix Released)."

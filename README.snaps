Canonical Supported Snaps
-------------------------
The Ubuntu Security Team track CVEs for Canonical supported snaps - these
are usually derived from sources outside the Ubuntu archive and so are
tracked separately.

Similar to product kernels, the usual '<release>_<source package>'
nomencalture is not applicable, so instead these are listed as
snap_<snap-name>.

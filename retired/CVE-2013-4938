Description:
 The LTI (aka IMS-LTI) mod_form implementation in Moodle through 2.1.10,
 2.2.x before 2.2.11, 2.3.x before 2.3.8, 2.4.x before 2.4.5, and 2.5.x
 before 2.5.1 does not properly support the sendname, sendemailaddr, and
 acceptgrades settings, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging an environment in
 which there was an ineffective attempt to enable the more secure values.

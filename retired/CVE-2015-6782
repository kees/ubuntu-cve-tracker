Description:
 The Document::open function in WebKit/Source/core/dom/Document.cpp in
 Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73 does not ensure that page-dismissal event
 handling is compatible with modal-dialog blocking, which makes it easier
 for remote attackers to spoof Omnibox content via a crafted web site.

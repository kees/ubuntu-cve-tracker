Description:
 The dissect_dvbci_tpdu_hdr function in epan/dissectors/packet-dvbci.c in
 the DVB-CI dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.9 and 1.10.x before
 1.10.1 does not validate a certain length value before decrementing it,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion
 failure and application exit) via a crafted packet.

Description:
 JGroups diagnostics service in JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform before
 5.2.2, SOA Platform before 5.3.0, and BRMS Platform before 5.3.0, is
 enabled without authentication when started by the JGroups channel, which
 allows remote attackers in adjacent networks to read diagnostics
 information via a crafted IP multicast.

Description:
 The login form in Roundcube Webmail before 0.5.1 does not properly handle a
 correctly authenticated but unintended login attempt, which makes it easier
 for remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information by arranging
 for a victim to login to the attacker's account and then compose an e-mail
 message, related to a "login CSRF" issue.

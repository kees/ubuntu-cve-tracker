Description:
 Integer overflow in the wxImage::Create function in src/common/image.cpp in
 wxWidgets 2.8.10 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted JPEG file, which triggers a
 heap-based buffer overflow.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is
 unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.

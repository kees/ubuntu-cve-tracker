Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
 AWT). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u141, 7u131 and
 8u121. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker
 with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE.
 Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the
 attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, attacks may
 significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this
 vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability
 applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java
 Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run
 untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the
 Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java
 deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code
 (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.3
 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).

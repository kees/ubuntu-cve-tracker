Description:
 An attempted excessive memory allocation was discovered in the function
 read_long_names in elf_begin.c in libelf in elfutils 0.174. Remote
 attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service
 via crafted elf input, which leads to an out-of-memory exception. NOTE: The
 maintainers believe this is not a real issue, but instead a "warning caused
 by ASAN because the allocation is big. By setting
 ASAN_OPTIONS=allocator_may_return_null=1 and running the reproducer,
 nothing happens."

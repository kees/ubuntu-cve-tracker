Description:
 LibreOffice is typically bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle
 vector graphics script, which can execute arbitrary python commands
 contained with the document it is launched from. LibreOffice also has a
 feature where documents can specify that pre-installed scripts can be
 executed on various document script events such as mouse-over, etc.
 Protection was added to block calling LibreLogo from script event handers.
 However a Windows 8.3 path equivalence handling flaw left LibreOffice
 vulnerable under Windows that a document could trigger executing LibreLogo
 via a Windows filename pseudonym. This issue affects: Document Foundation
 LibreOffice 6.2 versions prior to 6.2.7; 6.3 versions prior to 6.3.1.

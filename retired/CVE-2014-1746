Description:
 The InMemoryUrlProtocol::Read function in
 media/filters/in_memory_url_protocol.cc in Google Chrome before
 35.0.1916.114 relies on an insufficiently large integer data type, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read)
 via vectors that trigger use of a large buffer.

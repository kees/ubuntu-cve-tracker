 https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12662672/CVE-2014-3596.patch
Description:
 The getCN function in Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier does not properly verify
 that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name
 (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a certificate with a
 subject that specifies a common name in a field that is not the CN field.
 NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-5784.

 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-913-1
Description:
 The png_decompress_chunk function in pngrutil.c in libpng 1.0.x before
 1.0.53, 1.2.x before 1.2.43, and 1.4.x before 1.4.1 does not properly
 handle compressed ancillary-chunk data that has a disproportionately large
 uncompressed representation, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (memory and CPU consumption, and application hang) via a
 crafted PNG file, as demonstrated by use of the deflate compression method
 on data composed of many occurrences of the same character, related to a
 "decompression bomb" attack.

Description:
 pam_sm_authenticate in pam_pgsql.c in libpam-pgsql 0.6.3 does not properly
 consider operator precedence when evaluating the success of a pam_get_pass
 function call, which allows local users to gain privileges via a SIGINT
 signal when this function is executing, as demonstrated by a CTRL-C
 sequence at a sudo password prompt in an "auth sufficient pam_pgsql.so"
 configuration.

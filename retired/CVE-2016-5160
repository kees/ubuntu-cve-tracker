Description:
 The AllowCrossRendererResourceLoad function in
 extensions/browser/url_request_util.cc in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89
 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux does not properly use
 an extension's manifest.json web_accessible_resources field for
 restrictions on IFRAME elements, which makes it easier for remote attackers
 to conduct clickjacking attacks, and trick users into changing extension
 settings, via a crafted web site, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2016-5162.

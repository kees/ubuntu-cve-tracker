Description:
 systemd v233 and earlier fails to safely parse usernames starting with a
 numeric digit (e.g. "0day"), running the service in question with root
 privileges rather than the user intended.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> the upstream patch changes behaviour to cause a unit to fail to
 mdeslaur> load if a configuration item could not be parsed, instead of
 mdeslaur> skipping it. Fixing this may cause regressions in certain
 mdeslaur> environments. We will not be fixing this issue in xenial.
 mdeslaur> Administrators are encouraged to carefully audit their unit
 mdeslaur> files and make sure the options are being parsed correctly.

Description:
 An issue was discovered in mj2/opj_mj2_extract.c in OpenJPEG 2.3.0. The
 output prefix was not checked for length, which could overflow a buffer,
 when providing a prefix with 50 or more characters on the command line.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> -DBUILD_MJ2:BOOL=OFF is set in Ubuntu and Debian packaging,
   so code affected is not built.
 ccdm94> -DBUILD_MJ2 is set to ON in openjpeg, however, the vulnerable
 ccdm94> code is not present in this package since the file received
 ccdm94> as an argument is not processed in the same way as it is in
 ccdm94> openjpeg2, it is simply used as is.

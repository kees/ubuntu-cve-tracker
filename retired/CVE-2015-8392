Description:
 PCRE before 8.38 mishandles certain instances of the (?| substring, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (unintended recursion
 and buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
 crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object
 encountered by Konqueror, a related issue to CVE-2015-8384 and
 CVE-2015-8395.

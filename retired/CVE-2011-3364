Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> This is for the redhat-specific plugin, but we need to check
 mdeslaur> if the debian plugin has the same flaw, as it may be based on
 mdeslaur> the same code
 mdeslaur> We don't look vulnerable to this, and embedded newline chars
 mdeslaur> seem to be handled correctly.

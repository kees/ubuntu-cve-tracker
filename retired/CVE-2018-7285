Description:
 A NULL pointer access issue was discovered in Asterisk 15.x through 15.2.1.
 The RTP support in Asterisk maintains its own registry of dynamic codecs
 and desired payload numbers. While an SDP negotiation may result in a codec
 using a different payload number, these desired ones are still stored
 internally. When an RTP packet was received, this registry would be
 consulted if the payload number was not found in the negotiated SDP. This
 registry was incorrectly consulted for all packets, even those which are
 dynamic. If the payload number resulted in a codec of a different type than
 the RTP stream (for example, the payload number resulted in a video codec
 but the stream carried audio), a crash could occur if no stream of that
 type had been negotiated. This was due to the code incorrectly assuming
 that a stream of that type would always exist.

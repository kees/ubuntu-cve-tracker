Description:
 The dissect_sflow_245_address_type function in
 epan/dissectors/packet-sflow.c in the sFlow dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x
 before 1.8.4 does not properly handle length calculations for an invalid IP
 address type, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (infinite loop) via a packet that is neither IPv4 nor IPv6.

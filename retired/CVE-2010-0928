Description:
 OpenSSL 0.9.8i on the Gaisler Research LEON3 SoC on the Xilinx Virtex-II
 Pro FPGA uses a Fixed Width Exponentiation (FWE) algorithm for certain
 signature calculations, and does not verify the signature before providing
 it to a caller, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to
 determine the private key via a modified supply voltage for the
 microprocessor, related to a "fault-based attack."

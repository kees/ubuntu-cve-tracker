Description:
 enrol/index.php in Moodle 2.6.x before 2.6.3 does not check for the
 moodle/course:viewhiddencourses capability before listing hidden courses,
 which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive name and summary
 information about these courses by leveraging the guest role and visiting a
 crafted URL.

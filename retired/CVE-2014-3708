Description:
 A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenStack Compute (nova)
 looked up VM instances based on an IP address filter. An attacker with
 sufficient privileges on an OpenStack installation with a large amount of
 VMs could use this flaw to cause the main nova process to block for an
 extended amount of time.

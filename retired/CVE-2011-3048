Description:
 The png_set_text_2 function in pngset.c in libpng 1.0.x before 1.0.59,
 1.2.x before 1.2.49, 1.4.x before 1.4.11, and 1.5.x before 1.5.10 allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary
 code via a crafted text chunk in a PNG image file, which triggers a memory
 allocation failure that is not properly handled, leading to a heap-based
 buffer overflow.

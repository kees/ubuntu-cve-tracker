Description:
 In Adam Kropelin adk0212 APC UPS Daemon through 3.14.14, the default
 installation of APCUPSD allows a local authenticated, but unprivileged,
 user to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges by replacing the
 service executable apcupsd.exe with a malicious executable that will run
 with SYSTEM privileges at startup. This occurs because of "RW NT
 AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users" permissions for
 %SYSTEMDRIVE%\apcupsd\bin\apcupsd.exe.

Description:
 The RenderTable::simplifiedNormalFlowLayout function in
 core/rendering/RenderTable.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
 40.0.2214.91, skips captions during table layout in certain situations,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
 read) via unspecified vectors related to the Fonts implementation.

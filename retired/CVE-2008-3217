Description:
 PowerDNS Recursor before 3.1.6 does not always use the strongest random
 number generator for source port selection, which makes it easier for
 remote attack vectors to conduct DNS cache poisoning.  NOTE: this is
 related to incomplete integration of security improvements associated with
 addressing CVE-2008-1637.

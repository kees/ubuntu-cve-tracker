Description:
 Crypto++ (aka cryptopp) through 5.6.4 does not document the requirement for
 a compile-time NDEBUG definition disabling the many assert calls that are
 unintended in production use, which might allow context-dependent attackers
 to obtain sensitive information by leveraging access to process memory
 after an assertion failure, as demonstrated by reading a core dump.

Notes:
 ratliff> precise, trusty, xenial, yakkety all build using -NDEBUG
 msalvatore> I'm retiring this CVE and marking each release as "ignored". I've
             confirmed ratliff's above comment. In addition, the fix for this
             CVE is simply an update to the documentation.

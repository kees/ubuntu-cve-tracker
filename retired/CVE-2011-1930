Description:
 In klibc 1.5.20 and 1.5.21, the DHCP options written by ipconfig to
 /tmp/net-$DEVICE.conf are not properly escaped. This may allow a remote
 attacker to send a specially crafted DHCP reply which could execute
 arbitrary code with the privileges of any process which sources DHCP
 options.

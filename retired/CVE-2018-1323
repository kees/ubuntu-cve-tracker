Description:
 The IIS/ISAPI specific code in the Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector 1.2.0
 to 1.2.42 that normalised the requested path before matching it to the
 URI-worker map did not handle some edge cases correctly. If only a sub-set
 of the URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed via IIS, then it was possible
 for a specially constructed request to expose application functionality
 through the reverse proxy that was not intended for clients accessing
 Tomcat via the reverse proxy.

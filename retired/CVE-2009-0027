Description:
 The request handler in JBossWS in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
 (aka JBoss EAP or JBEAP) 4.2 before 4.2.0.CP06 and 4.3 before 4.3.0.CP04
 does not properly validate the resource path during a request for a WSDL
 file with a custom web-service endpoint, which allows remote attackers to
 read arbitrary XML files via a crafted request.

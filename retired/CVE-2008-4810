Description:
 The _expand_quoted_text function in libs/Smarty_Compiler.class.php in
 Smarty 2.6.20 before r2797 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP
 code via vectors related to templates and (1) a dollar-sign character, aka
 "php executed in templates;" and (2) a double quoted literal string, aka a
 "function injection security hole." NOTE: each vector affects slightly
 different SVN revisions.

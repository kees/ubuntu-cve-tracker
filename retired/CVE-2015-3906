Description:
 The logcat_dump_text function in wiretap/logcat.c in the Android Logcat
 file parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.5 does not properly handle a
 lack of \0 termination, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted message in
 a packet, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-3815.

Description:
 Interaction error in xdg-open allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 code by sending a file with a dangerous MIME type but using a safe type
 that Firefox sends to xdg-open, which causes xdg-open to process the
 dangerous file type through automatic type detection, as demonstrated by
 overwriting the .desktop file.

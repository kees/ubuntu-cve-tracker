Description:
 libsoup 2.32.2 and earlier does not validate certificates or clear the
 trust flag when the ssl-ca-file does not exist, which allows remote
 attackers to bypass authentication by connecting with a SSL connection.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This isn't actually a flaw in libsoup, it's a flaw in
 mdeslaur> applications that don't set ssl-strict, and don't set
 mdeslaur> ssl-ca-file, but expect SOUP_MESSAGE_CERTIFICATE_TRUSTED to
 mdeslaur> mean something. Applications should either set a ssl-ca-file,
 mdeslaur> or ignore SOUP_MESSAGE_CERTIFICATE_TRUSTED.
 mdeslaur> We aren't going to fix this in libsoup. Applications should be
 mdeslaur> fixed instead. Marked as ignored.

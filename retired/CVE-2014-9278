Description:
 The OpenSSH server, as used in Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and
 when running in a Kerberos environment, allows remote authenticated users
 to log in as another user when they are listed in the .k5users file of that
 user, which might bypass intended authentication requirements that would
 force a local login.

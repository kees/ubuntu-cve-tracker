Description:
 SQL injection vulnerability in blog/edit.php in Moodle 1.6.1 and earlier
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the format
 parameter as stored in the $blogEntry variable, which is not properly
 handled by the insert_record function, which calls _adodb_column_sql in the
 adodb layer (lib/adodb/adodb-lib.inc.php), which does not convert the data
 type to an int.

Description:
 Samba 3.4 before 3.4.2, 3.3 before 3.3.8, 3.2 before 3.2.15, and 3.0.12
 through 3.0.36, as used in the SMB subsystem in Apple Mac OS X 10.5.8 when
 Windows File Sharing is enabled, Fedora 11, and other operating systems,
 does not properly handle errors in resolving pathnames, which allows remote
 authenticated users to bypass intended sharing restrictions, and read,
 create, or modify files, in certain circumstances involving user accounts
 that lack home directories.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> from Apple's security announce: "An unchecked error condition exists
  in Samba. A user who does not have a configured home directory, and connects
  to the Windows File Sharing service, will be able to access the contents of
  the file system, subject to local file system permissions. This update
  addresses the issue by improving the handling of path resolution errors."

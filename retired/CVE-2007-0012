Description:
 Sun JRE 5.0 before update 14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (Internet Explorer crash) via an object tag with an encoded applet
 and an undefined name attribute, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference
 in jpiexp32.dll when the applet is decoded and passed to the JVM.

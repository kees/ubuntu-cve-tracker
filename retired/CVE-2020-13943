Description:
 If an HTTP/2 client connecting to Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M7,
 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.37 or 8.5.0 to 8.5.57 exceeded the agreed maximum number of
 concurrent streams for a connection (in violation of the HTTP/2 protocol),
 it was possible that a subsequent request made on that connection could
 contain HTTP headers - including HTTP/2 pseudo headers - from a previous
 request rather than the intended headers. This could lead to users seeing
 responses for unexpected resources.

Description:
 Versions of Puppet Enterprise prior to 2016.4.5 or 2017.2.1 failed to mark
 MCollective server private keys as sensitive (a feature added in Puppet
 4.6), so key values could be logged and stored in PuppetDB. These releases
 use the sensitive data type to ensure this won't happen anymore.

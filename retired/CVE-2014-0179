Description:
 It was found that libvirt passes the XML_PARSE_NOENT flag when parsing XML
 documents using the libxml2 library, in which case all XML entities in the
 parsed documents are expanded. A user able to force libvirtd to parse an
 XML document with an entity pointing to a file could use this flaw to read
 the contents of that file (limited to libvirt as shipped with Red Hat
 Enterprise Linux 7); parsing an XML document with an entity pointing to a
 special file that blocks on read access could cause libvirtd to hang
 indefinitely, resulting in a denial of service on the system.

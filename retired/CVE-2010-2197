Description:
 rpmbuild in RPM 4.8.0 and earlier does not properly parse the syntax of
 spec files, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to remove home
 directories via vectors involving a ;~ (semicolon tilde) sequence in a Name
 tag.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> rpm spec files can also trivially remove home directories. This
 mdeslaur> isn't an issue worth fixing since it is assumed source rpms
 mdeslaur> are verified before being used, either by using a signed package
 mdeslaur> from a trusted source, or by carefully auditing the spec file.
 mdeslaur> Downgrading to "negligible" and ignoring.

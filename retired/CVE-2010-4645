Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> unabele to reproduce on 9.10 and before; however, the code in
  question looks like it ought to be vulnerable. Looking at the compiler
  flag differences between lucid and karmic's builds didn't show any obvious
  reason why karmic wouldn't be affected. Released an update for all
  releases anyway.

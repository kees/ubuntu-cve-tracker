Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the CORBA component in Oracle Java SE and Java
 for Business 6 Update 21 and 5.0 Update 25 allows remote attackers to
 affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
 NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU.
 Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable downstream vendor that
 this involves the use of the privileged accept method in the ServerSocket
 class, which does not limit which hosts can connect and allows remote
 attackers to bypass intended network access restrictions.
Ubuntu-Description:
  It was discovered that the privileged accept method of the
  ServerSocket class in the CORBA implementation allowed it to receive
  connections from any host, instead of just the host of the current
  connection.  An attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions
  defined by network permissions.
Notes:
  sbeattie> red hat description: The privileged accept method of the
  ServerSocket class in the Common Object Request Broker Architecture
  (CORBA) implementation in OpenJDK allowed it to receive connections
  from any host, instead of just the host of the current connection. An
  attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions defined by
  network permissions.

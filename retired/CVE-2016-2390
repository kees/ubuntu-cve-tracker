Description:
 The FwdState::connectedToPeer method in FwdState.cc in Squid before 3.5.14
 and 4.0.x before 4.0.6 does not properly handle SSL handshake errors when
 built with the --with-openssl option, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) via a plaintext HTTP message.

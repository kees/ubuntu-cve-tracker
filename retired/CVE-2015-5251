Description:
 A flaw was discovered in the OpenStack Image service (glance) where a
 tenant could manipulate the status of their images by submitting an HTTP
 PUT request together with an 'x-image-meta-status' header. A malicious
 tenant could exploit this flaw to reactivate disabled images, bypass
 storage quotas, and in some cases replace image contents (where they have
 owner access). Setups using the Image service's v1 API could allow the
 illegal modification of image status. Additionally, setups which also use
 the v2 API could allow a subsequent re-upload of image contents.

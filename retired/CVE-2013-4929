Description:
 The parseFields function in epan/dissectors/packet-dis-pdus.c in the DIS
 dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.9 and 1.10.x before 1.10.1 does not
 terminate packet-data processing after finding zero remaining bytes, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (loop) via a crafted
 packet.

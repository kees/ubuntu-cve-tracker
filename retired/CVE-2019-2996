Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE
 (component: Deployment). The supported version that is affected is Java SE:
 8u221; Java SE Embedded: 8u221. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows
 unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
 compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human
 interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of
 this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete
 access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data as well as
 unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded
 accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
 typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or
 sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code
 (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
 security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically
 in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an
 administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.2 (Confidentiality and Integrity
 impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).

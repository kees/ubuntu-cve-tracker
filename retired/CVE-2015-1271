Description:
 PDFium, as used in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, does not properly
 handle certain out-of-memory conditions, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document that triggers a large
 memory allocation.

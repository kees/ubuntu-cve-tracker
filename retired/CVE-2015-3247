Description:
 A race condition flaw, leading to a heap-based memory corruption, was found
 in spice's worker_update_monitors_config() function, which runs under the
 QEMU-KVM context on the host. A user in a guest could leverage this flaw to
 crash the host QEMU-KVM process or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with
 the privileges of the host QEMU-KVM process.

Description:
 There is a flaw in the xml entity encoding functionality of libxml2 in
 versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to
 be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of
 libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this
 flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to
 confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory
 information to further exploit the application.

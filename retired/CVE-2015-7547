Description:
 A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the libresolv library
 performed dual A/AAAA DNS queries. A remote attacker could create a
 specially crafted DNS response which could cause libresolv to crash or,
 potentially, execute code with the permissions of the user running the
 library. Note: this issue is only exposed when libresolv is called from the
 nss_dns NSS service module.

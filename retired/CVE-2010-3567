Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the 2D component in Oracle Java SE and Java
 for Business 6 Update 21, and 5.0 Update 25 allows remote attackers to
 affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
 NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU.
 Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable downstream vendor that
 this is related to a calculation error in right-to-left text character
 counts for the ICU OpenType font rendering implementation, which triggers
 an out-of-bounds memory access.
Ubuntu-Description:
  It was discovered that a miscalculation in the OpenType font
  rendering implementation would allow out-of-bounds memory access. This
  could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
  of the user running a java application.
Notes:
  sbeattie> red hat description: Miscalculation in the OpenType font
  rendering implementation caused out-of-bounds memory access, which
  could allow remote attackers to execute code with the privileges
  of the user running the java process.

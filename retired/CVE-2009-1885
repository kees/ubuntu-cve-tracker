Description:
 Stack consumption vulnerability in validators/DTD/DTDScanner.cpp in Apache
 Xerces C++ 2.7.0 and 2.8.0 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
 denial of service (application crash) via vectors involving nested
 parentheses and invalid byte values in "simply nested DTD structures," as
 demonstrated by the Codenomicon XML fuzzing framework.

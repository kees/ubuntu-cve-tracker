Description:
 Ruby on Rails 2.1 before 2.1.3 and 2.2.x before 2.2.2 does not verify
 tokens for requests with certain content types, which allows remote
 attackers to bypass cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection for
 requests to applications that rely on this protection, as demonstrated
 using text/plain.

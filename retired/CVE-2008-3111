Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in Sun Java Web Start in JDK and JRE 6 before
 Update 4, JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 16, and SDK and JRE 1.4.x before
 1.4.2_18 allow context-dependent attackers to gain privileges via an
 untrusted application, as demonstrated by (a) an application that grants
 itself privileges to (1) read local files, (2) write to local files, or (3)
 execute local programs; and as demonstrated by (b) a long value associated
 with a java-vm-args attribute in a j2se tag in a JNLP file, which triggers
 a stack-based buffer overflow in the GetVMArgsOption function; aka CR
 6557220.

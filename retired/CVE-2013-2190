Description:
 The translate_hierarchy_event function in x11/clutter-device-manager-xi2.c
 in Clutter, when resuming the system, does not properly handle
 XIQueryDevice errors when a device has "disappeared," which causes the
 gnome-shell to crash and allows physically proximate attackers to access
 the previous gnome-shell session via unspecified vectors.

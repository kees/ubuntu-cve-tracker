Description:
 Vino, possibly before 3.2, does not properly document that it opens ports
 in UPnP routers when the "Configure network to automatically accept
 connections" setting is enabled, which might make it easier for remote
 attackers to perform further attacks.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> no upstream fix
 mdeslaur> oneiric+ has more explicit text: "Automatically configure UPnP
 mdeslaur> router to open and forward ports". Marking as not-affected.

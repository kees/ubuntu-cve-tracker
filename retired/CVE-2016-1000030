Description:
 Pidgin version <2.11.0 contains a vulnerability in X.509 Certificates
 imports specifically due to improper check of return values from
 gnutls_x509_crt_init() and gnutls_x509_crt_import() that can result in code
 execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via custom X.509
 certificate from another client. This vulnerability appears to have been
 fixed in 2.11.0.

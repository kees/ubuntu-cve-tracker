Description:
 In Django 1.10.x before 1.10.8 and 1.11.x before 1.11.5, HTML autoescaping
 was disabled in a portion of the template for the technical 500 debug page.
 Given the right circumstances, this allowed a cross-site scripting attack.
 This vulnerability shouldn't affect most production sites since you
 shouldn't run with "DEBUG = True" (which makes this page accessible) in
 your production settings.

Description:
 The DOM implementation in Google Chrome before 48.0.2564.109 does not
 properly restrict frame-attach operations from occurring during or after
 frame-detach operations, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same
 Origin Policy via a crafted web site, related to FrameLoader.cpp,
 HTMLFrameOwnerElement.h, LocalFrame.cpp, and WebLocalFrameImpl.cpp.

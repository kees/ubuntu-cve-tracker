Description:
 A resource vulnerability in the OpenStack Compute (nova), Block Storage
 (cinder), and Image (glance) services was found in their use of qemu-img.
 An unprivileged user could consume as much as 4 GB of RAM on the compute
 host by uploading a malicious image. This flaw could lead possibly to host
 out-of-memory errors and negatively affect other running tenant instances.
 oslo.concurrency has been updated to support process limits ('prlimit'),
 which is needed to fix this flaw.

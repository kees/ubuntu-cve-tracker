Description:
 The default configuration of IBUS 1.5.4, and possibly 1.5.2 and earlier,
 when IBus.InputPurpose.PASSWORD is not set and used with GNOME 3, does not
 obscure the entered password characters, which allows physically proximate
 attackers to obtain a user password by reading the lockscreen.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> 1.5.4 only. Specifically "1.5.2 or lower do not handle the input
  purpose so the typed chars are shown as the bug. 1.5.3 returns FALSE when the
  input purpose is password in IBus GTK+ IM modules instead of sending the key
  events to IBus engines so the problem does not appear. 1.5.4 adds the class
  method of set_content_type() in IBusEngine and IBus GTK+ IM modules send the
  input purpose to engines."

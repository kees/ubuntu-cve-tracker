Description:
 The ssh_agent_channel_data function in PuTTY before 0.68 allows remote
 attackers to have unspecified impact via a large length value in an agent
 protocol message and leveraging the ability to connect to the Unix-domain
 socket representing the forwarded agent connection, which trigger a buffer
 overflow.

 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-908-1
Description:
 The ap_proxy_ajp_request function in mod_proxy_ajp.c in mod_proxy_ajp in
 the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.15 does not properly handle certain
 situations in which a client sends no request body, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (backend server outage) via a
 crafted request, related to use of a 500 error code instead of the
 appropriate 400 error code.

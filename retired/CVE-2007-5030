Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in Dibbler 0.6.0 allow remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (daemon crash) via packets containing options with
 large lengths, which trigger attempts at excessive memory allocation, as
 demonstrated by (1) the TSrvMsg constructor in SrvMessages/SrvMsg.cpp; the
 (2) TClntMsg, (3) TClntOptIAAddress, (4) TClntOptIAPrefix, (5)
 TOptVendorSpecInfo, and (6) TOptOptionRequest constructors; and the (7)
 TRelIfaceMgr::decodeRelayRepl, (8) TRelMsg::decodeOpts, and (9)
 TSrvIfaceMgr::decodeRelayForw methods.

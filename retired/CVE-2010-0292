Description:
 The read_from_cmd_socket function in cmdmon.c in chronyd in Chrony before
 1.23.1, and 1.24-pre1, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (CPU and bandwidth consumption) by sending a spoofed cmdmon packet that
 triggers a continuous exchange of NOHOSTACCESS messages between two
 daemons, a related issue to CVE-2009-3563.

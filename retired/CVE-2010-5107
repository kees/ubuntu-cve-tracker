Description:
 The default configuration of OpenSSH through 6.1 enforces a fixed time
 limit between establishing a TCP connection and completing a login, which
 makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (connection-slot exhaustion) by periodically making many new TCP
 connections.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> this is a long-standing problem with any server that limits
  connections. This requires conffile changes.
 mdeslaur> Upstream has changed the default MaxStartups to 10:30:100 to
 mdeslaur> mitigate this issue.
 mdeslaur> Sysadmins can change the equivalent config locally.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> we will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, in
 mdeslaur> environments where this is a concern, we suggest settings the
 mdeslaur> MaxStartups value to 10:30:100 in the sshd_config file

Description:
 WebKit/Source/core/layout/LayoutBlock.cpp in Blink, as used in Google
 Chrome before 49.0.2623.75, does not properly determine when anonymous
 block wrappers may exist, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (incorrect cast and assertion failure) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code.

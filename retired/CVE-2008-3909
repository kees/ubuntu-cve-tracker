Description:
 The administration application in Django 0.91, 0.95, and 0.96 stores
 unauthenticated HTTP POST requests and processes them after successful
 authentication occurs, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
 request forgery (CSRF) attacks and delete or modify data via unspecified
 requests.

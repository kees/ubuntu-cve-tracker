Description:
 A bug exists in the way mod_ssl handled client renegotiations. A remote
 attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause mod_ssl to
 enter a loop leading to a denial of service. This bug can be only triggered
 with Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.37 when using OpenSSL version 1.1.1 or
 later, due to an interaction in changes to handling of renegotiation
 attempts.

Description:
 Python 2.7 before 3.4 only uses the last eight bits of the prefix to
 randomize hash values, which causes it to compute hash values without
 restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably and makes it
 easier for context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU
 consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash
 table.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2012-1150.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This is being fixed upstream by changing the hashing algorithm
 mdeslaur> to SipHash in python 3.4.
 mdeslaur> See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0456/
 mdeslaur> Upstream has no intention of backporting this change to stable
 mdeslaur> releases.
 mdeslaur> We will not be fixing this in older releases.

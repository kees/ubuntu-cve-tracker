Description:
 An authorization vulnerability in OpenStack Image service was discovered,
 which allowed image-status manipulation using locations. By removing the
 last location of an image, an authenticated user could change the status
 from 'active' to 'queue'. A malicious tenant could exploit this flaw to
 silently replace owned image data, regardless of its original creator or
 visibility settings. Only environments with show_multiple_locations set to
 true (not default) were affected.

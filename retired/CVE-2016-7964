Description:
 The sendRequest method in HTTPClient Class in file /inc/HTTPClient.php in
 DokuWiki 2016-06-26a and older, when media file fetching is enabled, has no
 way to restrict access to private networks. This allows users to scan ports
 of internal networks via SSRF, such as 10.0.0.1/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and
 192.168.0.0/16.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ebarretto> Setting status as ignored since upstream won't fix it.
 ebarretto> According to maintainer:
 ebarretto> The only way I see to properly fix this is to add a whitelist
 ebarretto> feature where an Admin can define the external hosts and IPs
 ebarretto> the wiki is allowed to contact. However for not breaking every
 ebarretto> already installed wiki we would need to keep this list empty
 ebarretto> (allowing all).
 ebarretto> TBH I feel like it's not our task to secure other computers.
 ebarretto> If a wiki server runs within a network that should not be
 ebarretto> reached from that wiki server, the wiki server should be
 ebarretto> isolated properly through at least outgoing firewall rules or
 ebarretto> by a proper DMZ setup.

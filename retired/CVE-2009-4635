 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-931-1
Description:
 FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted MOV container with improperly
 ordered tags that cause (1) mov.c and (2) utils.c to use inconsistent codec
 types and identifiers, leading to processing of a video-structure pointer
 by the mp3 decoder, and a stack-based buffer overflow.
Ubuntu-Description:

 mdeslaur> into the 5.x branch. I could not reproduce the issue with

 mdeslaur> caused a regression, so was removed in usn-931-2.

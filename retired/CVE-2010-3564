Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Communications Messaging Server
 (Sun Java System Messaging Server) component in Oracle Sun Products Suite
 7.0 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality and integrity via
 unknown vectors related to Webmail.  NOTE: the previous information was
 obtained from the October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims
 from a reliable downstream vendor that the Kerberos implementation does not
 properly check AP-REQ requests, which allows attackers to cause a denial of
 service in the JVM.  NOTE: CVE has not investigated the apparent
 discrepancy between the two vendors regarding the consequences of this
 issue.
Ubuntu-Description:
  It was discovered that the Kerberos implementation improperly
  checked AP-REQ requests, which could allow an attacker to cause a
  denial of service against the receiving JVM.
Notes:
  sbeattie> red hat description: The Kerberos implementation improperly
  checked the sanity of AP-REQ requests, which could cause a denial
  of service condition in the receiving Java Virtual Machine.

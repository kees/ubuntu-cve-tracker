Description:
 The V8LazyEventListener::prepareListenerObject function in
 bindings/core/v8/V8LazyEventListener.cpp in the V8 bindings in Blink, as
 used in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, does not properly compile
 listeners, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that leverage "type
 confusion."

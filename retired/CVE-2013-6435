Description:
 It was found that RPM wrote file contents to the target installation
 directory under a temporary name, and verified its cryptographic signature
 only after the temporary file has been written completely. Under certain
 conditions, the system interprets the unverified temporary file contents
 and extracts commands from it. This could allow an attacker to modify
 signed RPM files in such a way that they would execute code chosen by the
 attacker during package installation.

Description:
 sudo: It was discovered that the default sudo configuration on Red Hat
 Enterprise Linux and possibly other Linux implementations preserves the
 value of INPUTRC which could lead to information disclosure. A local user
 with sudo access to a restricted program that uses readline could use this
 flaw to read content from specially formatted files with elevated
 privileges provided by sudo.

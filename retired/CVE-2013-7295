Description:
 Tor before 0.2.4.20, when OpenSSL 1.x is used in conjunction with a certain
 HardwareAccel setting on Intel Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge platforms, does
 not properly generate random numbers for (1) relay identity keys and (2)
 hidden-service identity keys, which might make it easier for remote
 attackers to bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms via unspecified
 vectors.

Description:
 Red Hat 3scale (aka RH-3scale) API Management Platform (AMP) before 2.0.0
 would permit creation of an access token without a client secret. An
 attacker could use this flaw to circumvent authentication controls and gain
 access to restricted APIs. NOTE: some sources have a typo in which
 CVE-2017-7512 maps to an OpenVPN vulnerability. The proper CVE ID for that
 OpenVPN vulnerability is CVE-2017-7521. Specifically, CVE-2017-7521 is the
 correct CVE ID for TWO closely related findings in OpenVPN. Any source that
 lists BOTH CVE-2017-7512 and CVE-2017-7521 for OpenVPN should have listed
 ONLY CVE-2017-7521.

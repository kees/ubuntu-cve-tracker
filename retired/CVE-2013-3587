Description:
 The HTTPS protocol, as used in unspecified web applications, can encrypt
 compressed data without properly obfuscating the length of the unencrypted
 data, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain
 plaintext secret values by observing length differences during a series of
 guesses in which a string in an HTTP request URL potentially matches an
 unknown string in an HTTP response body, aka a "BREACH" attack, a different
 issue than CVE-2012-4929.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This likely needs to be fixed on an application
 mdeslaur> level, not in openssl or mod_deflate.
 mdeslaur> no actionable item for now.

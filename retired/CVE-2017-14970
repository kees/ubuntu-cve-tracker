Description:
 In lib/ofp-util.c in Open vSwitch (OvS) before 2.8.1, there are multiple
 memory leaks while parsing malformed OpenFlow group mod messages. NOTE: the
 vendor disputes the relevance of this report, stating "it can only be
 triggered by an OpenFlow controller, but OpenFlow controllers have much
 more direct and powerful ways to force Open vSwitch to allocate memory,
 such as by inserting flows into the flow table."

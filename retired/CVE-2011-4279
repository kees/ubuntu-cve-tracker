Description:
 Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.2 does not use the forceloginforprofiles setting
 for course-profiles access control, which makes it easier for remote
 attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via vectors involving
 use of a search engine, as demonstrated by the search functionality of
 Google, Yahoo!, Wrensoft Zoom, MSN, Yandex, and AltaVista.

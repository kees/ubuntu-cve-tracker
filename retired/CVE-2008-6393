Description:
 PSI Jabber client before 0.12.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a file transfer
 request with a negative value in a SOCKS5 option, which bypasses a signed
 integer check and triggers an integer overflow and a heap-based buffer
 overflow.

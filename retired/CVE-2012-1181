Description:
 fcgid_spawn_ctl.c in the mod_fcgid module 2.3.6 for the Apache HTTP Server
 does not recognize the FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass directive for a virtual
 host, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (memory consumption) via a series of HTTP requests that triggers a
 process count higher than the intended limit.

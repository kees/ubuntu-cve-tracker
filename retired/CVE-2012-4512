Description:
 A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the CSS parser of
 the Document Object Model's (DOM) implementation of KDE libraries performed
 processing of a location of a particular font face source. A remote
 attacker with privileges could provide a specially-crafted web page that,
 when opened in an application linked against KDE libraries, would lead to
 the application crashing or potential execution of arbitrary code.

Description:
 The nsHtml5TreeBuilder::resetTheInsertionMode function in the HTML5 Tree
 Builder in Mozilla Firefox before 24.0, Thunderbird before 24.0, and
 SeaMonkey before 2.21 does not properly maintain the state of the
 insertion-mode stack for template elements, which allows remote attackers
 to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer
 over-read) by triggering use of this stack in its empty state.

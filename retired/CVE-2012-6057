Description:
 The dissect_eigrp_metric_comm function in epan/dissectors/packet-eigrp.c in
 the EIGRP dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.4 uses the wrong data
 type for a certain offset value, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (integer overflow and infinite loop) via a malformed
 packet.

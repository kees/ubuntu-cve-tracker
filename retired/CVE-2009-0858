Description:
 The response_addname function in response.c in Daniel J. Bernstein djbdns
 1.05 and earlier does not constrain offsets in the required manner, which
 allows remote attackers, with control over a third-party subdomain served
 by tinydns and axfrdns, to trigger DNS responses containing arbitrary
 records via crafted zone data for this subdomain.

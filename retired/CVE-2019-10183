Description:
 The virt-install utility used to provision new virtual machines, in
 virt-manager v2.2.0, has introduced an option '--unattended' to create VMs
 without user interaction. This option accepts guest VM password as command
 line arguments. An attacker could obtain these passwords though process
 listings on the system.

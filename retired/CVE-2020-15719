Description:
 libldap in certain third-party OpenLDAP packages has a
 certificate-validation flaw when the third-party package is asserting
 RFC6125 support. It considers CN even when there is a non-matching
 subjectAltName (SAN). This is fixed in, for example, openldap-2.4.46-10.el8
 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

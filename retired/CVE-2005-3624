Description:
 The CCITTFaxStream::CCITTFaxStream function in Stream.cc for xpdf, gpdf,
 kpdf, pdftohtml, poppler, teTeX, CUPS, libextractor, and others allows
 attackers to corrupt the heap via negative or large integers in a
 CCITTFaxDecode stream, which lead to integer overflows and integer
 underflows.

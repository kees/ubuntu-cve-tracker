Description:
 Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.4, 2.0.x before 2.0.0.8, Mozilla Suite 1.7.13,
 Mozilla SeaMonkey 1.0.2 and other versions before 1.1.5, and Netscape 8.1
 and earlier allow user-assisted remote attackers to read arbitrary files by
 tricking a user into typing the characters of the target filename in a text
 box and using the OnKeyDown, OnKeyPress, and OnKeyUp Javascript keystroke
 events to change the focus and cause those characters to be inserted into a
 file upload input control, which can then upload the file when the user
 submits the form.

Description:
 In Apache FOP before 2.2, files lying on the filesystem of the server which
 uses FOP can be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG
 files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which
 the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full
 compromise of the server - including confidential or sensitive files -
 would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the
 server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can
 trivially trigger an amplification attack.

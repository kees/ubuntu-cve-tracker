Description:
 xcfa before 5.0.1 creates temporary files insecurely which could allow
 local users to launch a symlink attack and overwrite arbitrary files.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> Extensive unsafe use of /tmp leads me to believe the problems
  extend beyond just symlink or just hardlink issues, thus I'm not tagging
  this with the symlink-restriction or hardlink-restriction tags and I'm
  setting the Priority to "medium" rather than "low" as a result.

Description:
 CVE-2013-2006 OpenStack keystone: DEBUG level LDAP password disclosure in
 log files
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> requires debug logging to be set in keystone.conf.
  On 12.10 and higher, keystone.conf warns about passwords. Furthermore,
  level=WARNING is used in logging.conf
 jdstrand> 12.04 uses debug = True, but has level=WARNING in logging.conf and
  the log files are not readable on the system (ie the /var/log/keystone
  directory is 0700)
 jdstrand> Keystone on 11.10 is a pre-release version and unusable with other
  components such as nova and horizon
 jdstrand> fix requires a conffile change to fix non-default configurations
  that are marginally affected

Description:
 A DOM-based, cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the OpenStack
 dashboard, where user input was not filtered correctly. An authenticated
 dashboard user could exploit the flaw by injecting an AngularJS template
 into a dashboard form (for example, using an image's description),
 triggering the vulnerability when another user browsed the affected page.
 As a result, this flaw could result in user accounts being compromised (for
 example, user-access credentials being stolen).

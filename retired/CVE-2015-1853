Description:
 A denial of service flaw was found in the way chrony hosts that were
 peering with each other authenticated themselves before updating their
 internal state variables. An attacker could send packets to one peer host,
 which could cascade to other peers, and stop the synchronization process
 among the reached peers.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Miroslav Lichvár discovered a head-based buffer overflow in chrony. A remote
 attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or
 execute arbitrary code.

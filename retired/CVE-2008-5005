 specifying a long folder extension argument on the command line to the
 tmail or dmail program; and (b) remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
 by sending e-mail to a destination mailbox name composed of a username and
 '+' character followed by a long string, processed by the tmail or possibly
 dmail program.

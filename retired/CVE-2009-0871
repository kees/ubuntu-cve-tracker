Description:
 The SIP channel driver in Asterisk Open Source 1.4.22, 1.4.23, and
 1.4.23.1; 1.6.0 before 1.6.0.6; 1.6.1 before 1.6.1.0-rc2; and Asterisk
 Business Edition C.2.3, with the pedantic option enabled, allows remote
 authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash) via a SIP INVITE
 request without any headers, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference in
 the (1) sip_uri_headers_cmp and (2) sip_uri_params_cmp functions.

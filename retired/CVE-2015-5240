Description:
 A race-condition flaw leading to ACL bypass was discovered in OpenStack
 Networking (neutron). An authenticated user could change the owner of a
 port after it was created but before firewall rules were applied, thus
 preventing firewall control checks from occurring. All OpenStack Networking
 deployments that used either the ML2 plug-in or a plug-in that relied on
 the security groups AMQP API were affected.

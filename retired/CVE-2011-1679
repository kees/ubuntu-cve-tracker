Description:
 ncpfs 2.2.6 and earlier attempts to use (1) ncpmount to append to the
 /etc/mtab file and (2) ncpumount to append to the /etc/mtab.tmp file
 without first checking whether resource limits would interfere, which
 allows local users to trigger corruption of the /etc/mtab file via a
 process with a small RLIMIT_FSIZE value, a related issue to CVE-2011-1089.

Description:
 An out-of-bounds memory access flaw, leading to memory corruption or
 possibly an information leak, was found in QEMU's pit_ioport_read()
 function. A privileged guest user in a QEMU guest, which had QEMU PIT
 emulation enabled, could potentially, in rare cases, use this flaw to
 execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the hosting QEMU
 process.

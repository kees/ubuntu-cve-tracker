Description:
 The Debian build procedure for the smokeping package in wheezy before
 2.6.8-2+deb7u1 and jessie before 2.6.9-1+deb8u1 does not properly configure
 the way Apache httpd passes arguments to smokeping_cgi, which allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted CGI arguments.

Description:
 The parisc_show_stack function in arch/parisc/kernel/traps.c in the Linux
 kernel before 2.6.28-rc7 on PA-RISC allows local users to cause a denial of
 service (system crash) via vectors associated with an attempt to unwind a
 stack that contains userspace addresses.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Helge Deller discovered that PA-RISC stack unwinding was not handled correctly.
 A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading do a denial of service.
 This did not affect official Ubuntu kernels, but was fixed in the source for anyone
 performing HPPA kernel builds.
Notes:
 smb> The call do dump_stack was not added before v2.6.25-rc6. So the resulting panic will not happen.

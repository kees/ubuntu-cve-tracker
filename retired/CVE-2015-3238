Description:
 It was discovered that the _unix_run_helper_binary() function of PAM's
 unix_pam module could write to a blocking pipe, possibly causing the
 function to become unresponsive. An attacker able to supply large passwords
 to the unix_pam module could use this flaw to enumerate valid user
 accounts, or cause a denial of service on the system.

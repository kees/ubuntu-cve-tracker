Description:
 Hardlink before 0.1.2 suffer from multiple stack-based buffer overflow
 flaws because of the way directory trees with deeply nested directories are
 processed. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted directory
 tree, and trick the local user into consolidating it, leading to hardlink
 executable crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the
 privileges of the user running the hardlink executable.

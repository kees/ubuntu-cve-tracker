 http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2013-003.html
Description:
 The SIP channel driver in Asterisk Open Source 1.8.x before 1.8.20.2, 10.x
 before 10.12.2, and 11.x before 11.2.2; Certified Asterisk 1.8.15 before
 1.8.15-cert2; Asterisk Business Edition (BE) C.3.x before C.3.8.1; and
 Asterisk Digiumphones 10.x-digiumphones before 10.12.2-digiumphones
 exhibits different behavior for invalid INVITE, SUBSCRIBE, and REGISTER
 transactions depending on whether the user account exists, which allows
 remote attackers to enumerate account names by (1) reading HTTP status
 codes, (2) reading additional text in a 403 (aka Forbidden) response, or
 (3) observing whether certain retransmissions occur.

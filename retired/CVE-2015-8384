Description:
 PCRE before 8.38 mishandles the /(?J)(?'d'(?'d'\g{d}))/ pattern and related
 patterns with certain recursive back references, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated
 by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror, a related issue to
 CVE-2015-8392 and CVE-2015-8395.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> Issue affects PCRE3 only
 tyhicks> Marking 'low' since it requires PCRE to operate on untrusted regular
  expressions which is not very likely
 tyhicks> Per Debian, the fix for CVE-2015-3210 also fixes this issue
 mdeslaur> introduced in 8.34
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> CVE-2015-2325_CVE-2015-2326_CVE-2015-3210_CVE-2015-5073.patch

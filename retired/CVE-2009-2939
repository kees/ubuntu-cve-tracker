Description:
 The postfix.postinst script in the Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu postfix
 2.5.5 package grants the postfix user write access to
 /var/spool/postfix/pid, which might allow local users to conduct symlink
 attacks that overwrite arbitrary files.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per Weitse, the symlink attack should not be possible due to
  defensive programming. A subverted postfix process running as 'postfix'
  could replace the pid file, which master could then send signals to.

Description:
 This vulnerability in Apache Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.3, 7.0.0 to 7.3.0 relates to
 an XML external entity expansion (XXE) in Solr config files
 (solrconfig.xml, schema.xml, managed-schema). In addition, Xinclude
 functionality provided in these config files is also affected in a similar
 way. The vulnerability can be used as XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in
 order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server or the internal
 network. Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr 6.6.4 or Solr 7.3.1
 releases both of which address the vulnerability. Once upgrade is complete,
 no other steps are required. Those releases only allow external entities
 and Xincludes that refer to local files / zookeeper resources below the
 Solr instance directory (using Solr's ResourceLoader); usage of absolute
 URLs is denied. Keep in mind, that external entities and XInclude are
 explicitly supported to better structure config files in large
 installations. Before Solr 6 this was no problem, as config files were not
 accessible through the APIs.

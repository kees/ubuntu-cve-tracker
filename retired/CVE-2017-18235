Description:
 An issue was discovered in Exempi before 2.4.3. The VPXChunk class in
 XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/WEBP_Support.cpp does not ensure nonzero
 widths and heights, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (assertion failure and application exit) via a crafted .webp file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 leosilva> couldn't reproduce in trusty, xenial, artful and bionic.
 mdeslaur> trusty and xenial have no WEBP support

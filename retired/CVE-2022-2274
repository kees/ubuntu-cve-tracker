Description:
 The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA
 implementation for X86_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This
 issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on
 such machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation. As
 a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a
 remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLS
 servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on
 machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture are
 affected by this issue.

Description:
 OCaml before 4.03.0 does not properly handle sign extensions, which allows
 remote attackers to conduct buffer overflow attacks or obtain sensitive
 information as demonstrated by a long string to the String.copy function.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that OCaml mishandled sign extensions. A remote attacker
 could use this vulnerability to steal sensitive information, cause a denial of
 service (crash), or possibly execute arbitrary code.
Notes:
 msalvatore> binaries built with ocamlopt will need to be rebuilt after a system upgrade

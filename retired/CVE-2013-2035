Description:
 Race condition in
 hawtjni-runtime/src/main/java/org/fusesource/hawtjni/runtime/Library.java
 in HawtJNI before 1.8, when a custom library path is not specified, allows
 local users to execute arbitrary Java code by overwriting a temporary JAR
 file with a predictable name in /tmp.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that HawtJNI wrote files with predictable names to /tmp. A 
 local attacker could exploit a race condition by overwriting the predictably
 named temporary files, resulting in arbitrary code execution.

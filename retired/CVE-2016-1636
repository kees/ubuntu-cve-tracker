Description:
 The PendingScript::notifyFinished function in
 WebKit/Source/core/dom/PendingScript.cpp in Google Chrome before
 49.0.2623.75 relies on memory-cache information about integrity-check
 occurrences instead of integrity-check successes, which allows remote
 attackers to bypass the Subresource Integrity (aka SRI) protection
 mechanism by triggering two loads of the same resource.

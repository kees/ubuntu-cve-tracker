Description:
 The DefineConstantPool action in the ActionScript 2 virtual machine in
 Adobe Flash Player 10.x before 10.0.12.36 and 9.x before 9.0.151.0, and
 Adobe AIR before 1.5, accepts an untrusted input value for a "constant
 count," which allows remote attackers to read sensitive data from process
 memory via a crafted PDF file.

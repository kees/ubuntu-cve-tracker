Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the Networking component in Oracle Java SE and
 Java for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update 25, 1.4.2_27, and 1.3.1_28 allows
 remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via
 unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the
 October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable
 downstream vendor that HttpURLConnection does not properly check for the
 allowHttpTrace permission, which allows untrusted code to perform HTTP
 TRACE requests.
Ubuntu-Description:
  It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class improperly
  checked whether the calling code was granted the "allowHttpTrace"
  permission, allowing an attacker to create HTTP TRACE requests.
Notes:

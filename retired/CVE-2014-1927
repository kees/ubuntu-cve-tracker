Description:
 The shell_quote function in python-gnupg 0.3.5 does not properly quote
 strings, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code
 via shell metacharacters in unspecified vectors, as demonstrated using "$("
 command-substitution sequences, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2014-1928.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete
 fix for CVE-2013-7323.

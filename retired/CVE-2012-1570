Description:
 The resolver in MaraDNS before 1.3.0.7.15 and 1.4.x before 1.4.12
 overwrites cached server names and TTL values in NS records during the
 processing of a response to an A record query, which allows remote
 attackers to trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain names via a
 "ghost domain names" attack.

Description:
 Off-by-one error in the __opiereadrec function in readrec.c in libopie in
 OPIE 2.4.1-test1 and earlier, as used on FreeBSD 6.4 through 8.1-PRERELEASE
 and other platforms, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long username, as
 demonstrated by a long USER command to the FreeBSD 8.0 ftpd.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> in dapper and hardy, the off-by-one overflows into *c, which
 mdeslaur> isn't used after in the function, so it's harmless.
 mdeslaur> on jaunty+, fortify source makes opie abort, so it is a
 mdeslaur> denial of service.

Description:
 Jetty 6.x through 6.1.22 suffers from an escape sequence injection
 vulnerability from an attack vector by means of: 1) "Cookie Dump Servlet"
 and 2) Http Content-Length header. 1) A POST request to the form at
 "/test/cookie/" with the "Age" parameter set to a string throws a
 "java.lang.NumberFormatException" which reflects binary characters
 including ESC. These characters could be used to execute arbitrary commands
 or buffer dumps in the terminal. 2) The attack vector in 1) can be
 exploited by requesting a page using an HTTP request "Content-Length"
 header set to a consonant string (string including only letters).

Description:
 Elasticsearch versions before 6.8.13 and 7.9.2 contain a document
 disclosure flaw when Document or Field Level Security is used. Search
 queries do not properly preserve security permissions when executing
 certain complex queries. This could result in the search disclosing the
 existence of documents the attacker should not be able to view. This could
 result in an attacker gaining additional insight into potentially sensitive
 indices.

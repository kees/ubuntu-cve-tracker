Description:
 The tcd_free_encode function in tcd.c in OpenJPEG 1.3 through 1.5 allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted tile information in a Gray16
 TIFF image, which causes insufficient memory to be allocated and leads to
 an "invalid free."

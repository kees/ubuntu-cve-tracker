Description:
 The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk before 1.2.22 and 1.4.x
 before 1.4.8, Business Edition before B.2.2.1, AsteriskNOW before beta7,
 Appliance Developer Kit before 0.5.0, and s800i before 1.0.2 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted (1) LAGRQ or
 (2) LAGRP frame that contains information elements of IAX frames, which
 results in a NULL pointer dereference when Asterisk does not properly set
 an associated variable.

Description:
 An issue was discovered in Varnish Cache before 6.0.5 LTS, 6.1.x and 6.2.x
 before 6.2.2, and 6.3.x before 6.3.1. It does not clear a pointer between
 the handling of one client request and the next request within the same

 connection workspace, such as data structures associated with previous
 requests within this connection or VCL-related temporary headers.

Description:
 The download implementation in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows
 and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux does not properly restrict saving
 a file:// URL that is referenced by an http:// URL, which makes it easier
 for user-assisted remote attackers to discover NetNTLM hashes and conduct
 SMB relay attacks via a crafted web page that is accessed with the "Save
 page as" menu choice.

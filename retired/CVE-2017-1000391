Description:
 Jenkins versions 2.88 and earlier and 2.73.2 and earlier stores metadata
 related to 'people', which encompasses actual user accounts, as well as
 users appearing in SCM, in directories corresponding to the user ID on
 disk. These directories used the user ID for their name without additional
 escaping, potentially resulting in problems like overwriting of unrelated
 configuration files.

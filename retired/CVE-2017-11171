Description:
 Bad reference counting in the context of accept_ice_connection() in
 gsm-xsmp-server.c in old versions of gnome-session up until version 2.29.92
 allows a local attacker to establish ICE connections to gnome-session with
 invalid authentication data (an invalid magic cookie). Each failed
 authentication attempt will leak a file descriptor in gnome-session. When
 the maximum number of file descriptors is exhausted in the gnome-session
 process, it will enter an infinite loop trying to communicate without
 success, consuming 100% of the CPU. The graphical session associated with
 the gnome-session process will stop working correctly, because
 communication with gnome-session is no longer possible.

Description:
 PHP before 4.4.3 and 5.x before 5.1.4 does not limit the character set of
 the session identifier (PHPSESSID) for third party session handlers, which
 might make it easier for remote attackers to exploit other vulnerabilities
 by inserting PHP code into the PHPSESSID, which is stored in the session
 file.  NOTE: it could be argued that this not a vulnerability in PHP
 itself, rather a design limitation that enables certain attacks against
 session handlers that do not account for this limitation.

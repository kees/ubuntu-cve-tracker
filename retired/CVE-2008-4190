Description:
 The IPSEC livetest tool in Openswan 2.4.12 and earlier, and 2.6.x through
 2.6.16, allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files and execute
 arbitrary code via a symlink attack on the (1) ipseclive.conn and (2)
 ipsec.olts.remote.log temporary files.  NOTE: in many distributions and the
 upstream version, this tool has been disabled.

Description:
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. The
 redis-cli command line tool and redis-sentinel service may be vulnerable to
 integer overflow when parsing specially crafted large multi-bulk network
 replies. This is a result of a vulnerability in the underlying hiredis
 library which does not perform an overflow check before calling the
 calloc() heap allocation function. This issue only impacts systems with
 heap allocators that do not perform their own overflow checks. Most modern
 systems do and are therefore not likely to be affected. Furthermore, by
 default redis-sentinel uses the jemalloc allocator which is also not
 vulnerable. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and
 5.0.14.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> this appears to be about systems with a non-functional
  calloc() call. This feels like it should be a bug report abuot those
  allocator libraries with a broken calloc() instead. I assume this is
  not actually applicable to anything we ship.

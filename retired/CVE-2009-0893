Description:
 Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in xvidcore/src/decoder.c in the
 xvidcore library in Xvid before 1.2.2, as used by Windows Media Player and
 other applications, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
 providing a crafted macroblock (aka MBlock) number in a video stream in a
 crafted movie file that triggers heap memory corruption, related to a
 "missing resync marker range check" and the (1) decoder_iframe, (2)
 decoder_pframe, and (3) decoder_bframe functions.

Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE
 (component: Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE:
 7u231, 8u221, 11.0.4 and 13; Java SE Embedded: 8u221. Difficult to exploit
 vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via
 multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful
 attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker.
 Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read
 access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This
 vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running
 sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE
 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
 internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can
 also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a
 web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.1
 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).

Description:
 There is an issue with grub2 before version 2.06 while handling symlink on
 ext filesystems. A filesystem containing a symbolic link with an inode size
 of UINT32_MAX causes an arithmetic overflow leading to a zero-sized memory
 allocation with subsequent heap-based buffer overflow.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Chris Coulson discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in
 GRUB2 when handling certain filesystems, font files or PNG images,
 leading to heap-based buffer overflows. A local attacker could
 use these to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot
 restrictions.
Notes: 
 alexmurray| grub2-signed is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (precise/esm)
  and so marking the priority for grub2 in this release as low

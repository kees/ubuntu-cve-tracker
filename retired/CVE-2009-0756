Description:
 The JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg function in Poppler before 0.10.4 allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a PDF file that
 triggers a parsing error, which is not properly handled by
 JBIG2SymbolDict::~JBIG2SymbolDict and triggers an invalid memory
 dereference.

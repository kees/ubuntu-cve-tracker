Description:
 Tor before 0.1.2.16, when ControlPort is enabled, does not properly
 restrict commands to localhost port 9051, which allows remote attackers to
 modify the torrc configuration file, compromise anonymity, and have other
 unspecified impact via HTTP POST data containing commands without valid
 authentication, as demonstrated by an HTML form (1) hosted on a web site or
 (2) injected by a Tor exit node.

Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in Conquest 8.2a and earlier (1) allow local
 users to gain privileges by querying a metaserver that sends a long server
 entry processed by metaGetServerList and allow remote metaservers to
 execute arbitrary code via a long server entry processed by
 metaGetServerList; (2) allow attackers to have an unknown impact by
 exceeding the configured number of metaservers; and allow remote attackers
 to corrupt memory via a SP_CLIENTSTAT packet with certain values of (3)
 unum or (4) snum, different vulnerabilities than CVE-2003-0933.

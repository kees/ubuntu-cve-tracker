Description:
 Bip before 0.8.9, when running as a daemon, writes SSL handshake errors to
 an unexpected file descriptor that was previously associated with stderr
 before stderr has been closed, which allows remote attackers to write to
 other sockets and have an unspecified impact via a failed SSL handshake, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2011-5268. NOTE: some sources originally
 mapped this CVE to two different types of issues; this CVE has since been
 SPLIT, producing CVE-2011-5268.

Description:
 The ssl.match_hostname function in CPython (aka Python) before 2.7.9 and
 3.x before 3.3.3 does not properly handle wildcards in hostnames, which
 might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via a crafted
 certificate.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> This CVE is specifically for the multiple wildcards issue and not the
  change in behavior from RFC 2818 to RFC 6125
 tyhicks> Note that revision 10d0edadbcdd changes the behavior over to RFC 6125
  which may cause compatibability issues in old releases
 mdeslaur> since this introduces a behaviour change, we will not be fixing
 mdeslaur> this in stable releases.

Description:
 The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk 1.2 before revision 72630
 and 1.4 before revision 65679, when configured to allow unauthenticated
 calls, sends "early audio" to an unverified source IP address of a NEW
 message, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (traffic amplification) via a spoofed NEW message.

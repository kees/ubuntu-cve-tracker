Description:
 PCRE 7.8 and 8.32 through 8.37, and PCRE2 10.10 mishandle group empty
 matches, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (stack-based buffer overflow) via a crafted regular expression, as
 demonstrated by /^(?:(?(1)\\.|([^\\\\W_])?)+)+$/.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> This might be disputed, Tavis says it is likely php misusing the
  pcre3 API. I suspect allowing attackers to supply regular expressions is
  always going to be a bad idea.
 mdeslaur> upsteam bug says this is an issue with php, and are not going to
 mdeslaur> fix, so marking this as not-affected

Description:
 lib/viewvc.py in ViewVC 1.0.5 uses the content-type parameter in the HTTP
 request for the Content-Type header in the HTTP response, which allows
 remote attackers to cause content to be misinterpreted by the browser via a
 content-type parameter that is inconsistent with the requested object.
 NOTE: this issue might not be a vulnerability, since it requires attacker
 access to the repository that is being viewed.

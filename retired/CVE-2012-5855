Description:
 The SHAddToRecentDocs function in VideoLAN VLC media player 2.0.4 and
 earlier might allow user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) via a crafted file name that triggers an incorrect string-length
 calculation when the file is added to VLC.  NOTE: it is not clear whether
 this issue crosses privilege boundaries or whether it can be exploited
 without user interaction.

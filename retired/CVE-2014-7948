Description:
 The AppCacheUpdateJob::URLFetcher::OnResponseStarted function in
 content/browser/appcache/appcache_update_job.cc in Google Chrome before
 40.0.2214.91 proceeds with AppCache caching for SSL sessions even if there
 is an X.509 certificate error, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
 spoof HTML5 application content via a crafted certificate.

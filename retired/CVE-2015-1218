Description:
 Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in the DOM implementation in Blink,
 as used in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, allow remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via
 vectors that trigger movement of a SCRIPT element to different documents,
 related to (1) the HTMLScriptElement::didMoveToNewDocument function in
 core/html/HTMLScriptElement.cpp and (2) the
 SVGScriptElement::didMoveToNewDocument function in
 core/svg/SVGScriptElement.cpp.

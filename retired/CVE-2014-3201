Description:
 core/rendering/compositing/RenderLayerCompositor.cpp in Blink, as used in
 Google Chrome before 38.0.2125.102 on Android, does not properly handle a
 certain IFRAME overflow condition, which allows remote attackers to spoof
 content via a crafted web site that interferes with the scrollbar.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> Our packages include the RenderLayerCompositor.cpp file; I assume
  this affects us, too, despite the "on Android" mention.

Description:
 The default vhost configuration file in Puppet before 3.6.2 does not
 include the SSLCARevocationCheck directive, which might allow remote
 attackers to obtain sensitive information via a revoked certificate when a
 Puppet master runs with Apache 2.4.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> triggered under apache 2.4 only
 mdeslaur> later Debian packages don't enable SSLCARevocationCheck by
 mdeslaur> default, just simply add it as a commented-out example to the
 mdeslaur> config file. We are not going to fix this in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
 mdeslaur> If this is required, it can simply be added to the local
 mdeslaur> configuration.

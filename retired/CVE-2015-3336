Description:
 Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90 does not always ask the user before
 proceeding with CONTENT_SETTINGS_TYPE_FULLSCREEN and
 CONTENT_SETTINGS_TYPE_MOUSELOCK changes, which allows user-assisted remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (UI disruption) by constructing a
 crafted HTML document containing JavaScript code with requestFullScreen and
 requestPointerLock calls, and arranging for the user to access this
 document with a file: URL.

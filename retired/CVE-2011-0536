Description:
 Multiple untrusted search path vulnerabilities in elf/dl-object.c in
 certain modified versions of the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6),
 including glibc-2.5-49.el5_5.6 and glibc-2.12-1.7.el6_0.3 in Red Hat
 Enterprise Linux, allow local users to gain privileges via a crafted
 dynamic shared object (DSO) in a subdirectory of the current working
 directory during execution of a (1) setuid or (2) setgid program that has
 $ORIGIN in (a) RPATH or (b) RUNPATH within the program itself or a
 referenced library. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect fix for
 CVE-2010-3847.

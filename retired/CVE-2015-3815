Description:
 The detect_version function in wiretap/logcat.c in the Android Logcat file
 parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.5 does not check the length of the
 payload, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a packet with a crafted
 payload, as demonstrated by a length of zero, a different vulnerability
 than CVE-2015-3906.

Description:
 Text_Filter/lib/Horde/Text/Filter/Xss.php in Horde Application Framework
 before 3.3.6, Horde Groupware before 1.2.5, and Horde Groupware Webmail
 Edition before 1.2.5 does not properly handle data: URIs, which allows
 remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via
 data:text/html values for the HREF attribute of an A element in an HTML
 e-mail message.  NOTE: the vendor states that the issue is caused by "an
 XSS vulnerability in Firefox browsers."

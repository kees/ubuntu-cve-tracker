Description:
 The random number generator in the Crypto application before 2.0.2.2, and
 SSH before 2.0.5, as used in the Erlang/OTP ssh library before R14B03, uses
 predictable seeds based on the current time, which makes it easier for
 remote attackers to guess DSA host and SSH session keys.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Debian squeeze has fix in 1:14.a-dfsg-3squeeze1
 mdeslaur> erlang-ssh in in universe in lucid and natty. Patch only
 mdeslaur> adds new functions to crypto library, doesn't change existing
 mdeslaur> ones, so downgrading priority.
 mdeslaur> Backport is difficult due to appup changes.

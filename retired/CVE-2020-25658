Description:
 It was found that python-rsa is vulnerable to Bleichenbacher timing
 attacks. An attacker can use this flaw via the RSA decryption API to
 decrypt parts of the cipher text encrypted with RSA.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm| upstream fix is a mitigation at best
 eslerm| dev states that a non-Python is likely needed for fix
 eslerm| and "Python-RSA is a pure-Python RSA implementation."

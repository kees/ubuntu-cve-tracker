Description:
 A missing authorization flaw was found in the libvirt API responsible for
 changing the QEMU agent response timeout. This flaw allows read-only
 connections to adjust the time that libvirt waits for the QEMU guest agent
 to respond to agent commands. Depending on the timeout value that is set,
 this flaw can make guest agent commands fail because the agent cannot
 respond in time. Unprivileged users with a read-only connection could abuse
 this flaw to set the response timeout for all guest agent messages to zero,
 potentially leading to a denial of service. This flaw affects libvirt
 versions before 6.2.0.

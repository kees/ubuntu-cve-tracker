Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the Panel (xfce4-panel) component in Xfce
 before 4.4.2 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
 Launcher tooltips.  NOTE: a second buffer overflow (over-read) in the
 xfce_mkdirhier function was also reported, but it might not be exploitable
 for a crash or code execution, so it is not a vulnerability.

Description:
 Apache Tomcat 4.1.0 through 4.1.37, 5.5.0 through 5.5.26, and 6.0.0 through
 6.0.16, when a RequestDispatcher is used, performs path normalization
 before removing the query string from the URI, which allows remote
 attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and read arbitrary files
 via a .. (dot dot) in a request parameter.

Description:
 The HTTPS protocol does not consider the role of the TCP congestion window
 in providing information about content length, which makes it easier for
 remote attackers to obtain cleartext data by leveraging a web-browser
 configuration in which third-party cookies are sent, aka a "HEIST" attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> NVD had this CVE assigned to multiple browers as of 2016-09-12.
  This CVE appears to cover a wide variety of browser side channels
  demonstrating the time difference between first byte and last byte in
  a response. This can be used both for compression-based determinations
  of exact strings from requests that are reflected in responses as well
  as uncompressed responses from sites that have disabled compression
  to mitigate BEAST or CRIME.
 seth-arnold> The paper authors recommend users disable third-party cookies
  in their browsers, with the caveat that many services will break.
 mdeslaur> We have no actionable item to fix this CVE.
 mdeslaur> Since we release new firefox, thunderbird and chromium upstream
 mdeslaur> releases, I'm marking this as ignored.

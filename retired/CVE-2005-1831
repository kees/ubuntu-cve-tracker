Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  Sudo 1.6.8p7 on SuSE Linux 9.3, and possibly other Linux
 distributions, allows local users to gain privileges by using sudo to call
 su, then entering a blank password and hitting CTRL-C. NOTE: SuSE and
 multiple third-party researchers have not been able to replicate this
 issue, stating "Sudo catches SIGINT and returns an empty string for the
 password so I don't see how this could happen unless the user's actual
 password was empty."

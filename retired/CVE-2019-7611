Description:
 A permission issue was found in Elasticsearch versions before 5.6.15 and
 6.6.1 when Field Level Security and Document Level Security are disabled
 and the _aliases, _shrink, or _split endpoints are used . If the
 elasticsearch.yml file has xpack.security.dls_fls.enabled set to false,
 certain permission checks are skipped when users perform one of the actions
 mentioned above, to make existing data available under a new index/alias
 name. This could result in an attacker gaining additional permissions
 against a restricted index.

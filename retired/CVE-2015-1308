Description:
 kde-workspace 4.2.0 and plasma-workspace before 5.1.95 allows remote
 attackers to obtain input events, and consequently obtain passwords, by
 leveraging access to the X server when the screen is locked.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> under X, apps can pretty much sniff input events anyway
 tsimonq2> The only release that is affected by this is Trusty, and upstream
 tsimonq2> recommends against backporting a fix (it's low priority anyways)

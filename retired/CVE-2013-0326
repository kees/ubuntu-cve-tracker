Description:
 OpenStack nova base images permissions are world readable
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> /var/lib/nova/instances/_base/ apparently stores images with DAC
  permissions set to 0644. Deferred while waiting for upstream to address
  the issue -- I suspect the fix is simple, but the consequences may not be.
 jdstrand> Ignoring. VMs are confined by AppArmor and are not able to read
  each other's files. Even if this were not the case, the files would be
  readable by the the libvirt-qemu:kvm user, so changing the permissions to
  0640 would not help greatly. Therefore the protection would only be against
  other users on the system and a typical production Nova installation will
  not have these types of users or extra services. Furthermore, changing the
  permissions in a security update could be disruptive to production systems
  on upgrade.
 jdstrand> no upstream fix as of 2014-05-05

Description:
 The --mirror documentation for Git through 2.35.1 does not mention the
 availability of deleted content, aka the "GitBleed" issue. This could
 present a security risk if information-disclosure auditing processes rely
 on a clone operation without the --mirror option.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 eslerm> --mirror appears to work as intended and clearly documents that all
 eslerm> refs are copied (which includes deleted branches and git reset data)

Description:
 The pcapng_read_if_descr_block function in wiretap/pcapng.c in the pcapng
 parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.8 uses too many levels of pointer
 indirection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (incorrect free and application crash) via a crafted packet that triggers
 interface-filter copying.

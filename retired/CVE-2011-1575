Description:
 The STARTTLS implementation in ftp_parser.c in Pure-FTPd before 1.0.30 does
 not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle
 attackers to insert commands into encrypted FTP sessions by sending a
 cleartext command that is processed after TLS is in place, related to a
 "plaintext command injection" attack, a similar issue to CVE-2011-0411.

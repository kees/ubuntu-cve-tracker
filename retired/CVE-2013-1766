Description:
 libvirt 1.0.2 and earlier sets the group owner to kvm for device files,
 which allows local users to write to these files via unspecified vectors.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Debian bug reports states this is a problem because the kvm group
  is a general-purpose group and therefore changing device group ownership
  exposes these devices to other groups on the system. The kvm group on Ubuntu
  has been used since Ubuntu 10.10. Debian's solution is to update the
  packaging to add a new libvirt-qemu groupi, have the libvirt-qemu user be
  in the libvirt-qemu group as a secondary group, then use as a configure
  option: --with-qemu-group=libvirt-qemu. This is too intrusive for a stable
  release for an arguably marginal security gain.

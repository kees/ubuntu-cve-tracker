Description:
 An Ubuntu-specific patch in PulseAudio created a race condition where the
 snap policy module would fail to identify a client connection from a snap
 as coming from a snap if SCM_CREDENTIALS were missing, allowing the snap to
 connect to PulseAudio without proper confinement. This could be exploited
 by an attacker to expose sensitive information. Fixed in
 1:13.99.3-1ubuntu2, 1:13.99.2-1ubuntu2.1, 1:13.99.1-1ubuntu3.8,
 1:11.1-1ubuntu7.11, and 1:8.0-0ubuntu3.15.

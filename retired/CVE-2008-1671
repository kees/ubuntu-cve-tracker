Description:
 start_kdeinit in KDE 3.5.5 through 3.5.9, when installed setuid root,
 allows local users to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via "user-influenceable input" (probably command-line
 arguments) that cause start_kdeinit to send SIGUSR1 signals to other
 processes.

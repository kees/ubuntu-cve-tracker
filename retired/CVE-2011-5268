Description:
 connection.c in Bip before 0.8.9 does not properly close sockets, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (file descriptor
 consumption and crash) via multiple failed SSL handshakes, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2013-4550.  NOTE: this issue was SPLIT from
 CVE-2013-4550 because it is a different type of issue.

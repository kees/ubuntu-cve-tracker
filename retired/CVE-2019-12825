Description:
 Unauthorized Access to the Container Registry of other groups was
 discovered in GitLab Enterprise 12.0.0-pre. In other words, authenticated
 remote attackers can read Docker registries of other groups. When a
 legitimate user changes the path of a group, Docker registries are not
 adapted, leaving them in the old namespace. They are not protected and are
 available to all other users with no previous access to the repo.

Description:
 mod_userdir in lighttpd before 1.4.20, when a case-insensitive operating
 system or filesystem is used, performs case-sensitive comparisons on
 filename components in configuration options, which might allow remote
 attackers to bypass intended access restrictions, as demonstrated by a
 request for a .PHP file when there is a configuration rule for .php files.

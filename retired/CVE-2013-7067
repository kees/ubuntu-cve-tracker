Description:
 The OG Features module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.4 for Drupal does not properly
 override pages that have an access callback set to false, which allows
 remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a request.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 leosilva> Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed OG Features module, there is nothing you need to do.
 leosilva> If you use the OG Features module for Drupal 6.x, upgrade to OG Features 6.x-1.4

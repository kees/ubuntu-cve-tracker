Description:
 The gtkui_conf_read function in src/interfaces/gtk/ec_gtk_conf.c in
 Ettercap 0.7.3, when the GTK interface is used, does not ensure that the
 contents of the .ettercap_gtk file are controlled by the root user, which
 allows local users to conduct stack-based buffer overflow attacks and
 possibly execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service (memory
 consumption), or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted lines
 in this file.

Description:
 The GTK version of ettercap uses a global settings file at
 /tmp/.ettercap_gtk and does not verify ownership of this file. When parsing
 this file for settings in gtkui_conf_read()
 (src/interfacesgtk/ec_gtk_conf.c), an unchecked sscanf() call allows a
 maliciously placed settings file to overflow a statically-sized buffer on
 the stack.

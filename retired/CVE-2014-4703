Description:
 lib/parse_ini.c in Nagios Plugins 2.0.2 allows local users to obtain
 sensitive information via a symlink attack on the configuration file in the
 extra-opts flag.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete
 fix for CVE-2014-4701.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> Ubuntu wasn't affected by CVE-2014-4701; further, Ubuntu's default
  kernels include Yama-based symlink and hardlink restrictions making the race
  much less useful. Marked not-affected because we haven't yet applied fix for
  CVE-2014-4701.

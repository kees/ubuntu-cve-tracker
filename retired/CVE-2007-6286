Description:
 Apache Tomcat 5.5.11 through 5.5.25 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.15, when the
 native APR connector is used, does not properly handle an empty request to
 the SSL port, which allows remote attackers to trigger handling of "a
 duplicate copy of one of the recent requests," as demonstrated by using
 netcat to send the empty request.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 fujitsu> At least 5.5 doesn't use the native APR connector.

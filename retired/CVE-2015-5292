Description:
 It was found that SSSD's Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) responder
 plug-in would leak a small amount of memory on each authentication request.
 A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to exhaust all available
 memory on the system by making repeated requests to a Kerberized daemon
 application configured to authenticate using the PAC responder plug-in.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> according to debian, the responder part is not built, so might
  not be affected

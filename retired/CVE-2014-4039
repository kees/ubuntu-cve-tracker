Description:
 ppc64-diag 2.6.1 uses 0775 permissions for /tmp/diagSEsnap and does not
 properly restrict permissions for /tmp/diagSEsnap/snapH.tar.gz, which
 allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading files in this
 archive, as demonstrated by /var/log/messages and /etc/yaboot.conf.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> in trusty, powerpc-utils does not contain the snap script, so
   no file generated
 sbeattie> in yakkety and newer, powerpc-utils dropped the snap script, so
   no file generated there; yakkety has a patch applied by debian to
   adjust the directory permissions as well, but it's a moot point.
 sbeattie> in xenial, the snap script refuses to run on Ubuntu, due to
   not supporting the distro, and again won't create the file.

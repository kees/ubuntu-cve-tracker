Description:
 The ExpandCert function in Apache-SSL before apache_1.3.41+ssl_1.59 does
 not properly handle (1) '/' and (2) '=' characters in a Distinguished Name
 (DN) in a client certificate, which might allow remote attackers to bypass
 authentication via a crafted DN that triggers overwriting of environment
 variables.

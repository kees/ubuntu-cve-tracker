Description:
 Firefox 1.0 does not prevent the user from dragging an executable file to
 the desktop when it has an image/gif content type but has a dangerous
 extension such as .bat or .exe, which allows remote attackers to bypass the
 intended restriction and execute arbitrary commands via malformed GIF files
 that can still be parsed by the Windows batch file parser, aka
 "firedragging."

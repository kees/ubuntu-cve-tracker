Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Buffer overflow in the SQLDriverConnect function in unixODBC
 2.3.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long
 string in the DRIVER option. NOTE: this issue might not be a vulnerability,
 since the ability to set this option typically implies that the attacker
 already has legitimate access to cause a DoS or execute code, and therefore
 the issue would not cross privilege boundaries. There may be limited attack
 scenarios if isql command-line options are exposed to an attacker, although
 it seems likely that other, more serious issues would also be exposed, and
 this issue might not cross privilege boundaries in that context.

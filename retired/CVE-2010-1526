Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in libgdiplus 2.6.7, as used in Mono, allow
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a crafted TIFF file, related to
 the gdip_load_tiff_image function in tiffcodec.c; (2) a crafted JPEG file,
 related to the gdip_load_jpeg_image_internal function in jpegcodec.c; or
 (3) a crafted BMP file, related to the gdip_read_bmp_image function in
 bmpcodec.c, leading to heap-based buffer overflows.

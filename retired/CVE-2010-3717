Description:
 The t3lib_div::validEmail function in TYPO3 4.2.x before 4.2.15, 4.3.x
 before 4.3.7, and 4.4.x before 4.4.4 does not properly restrict input to
 filter_var FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL operations in PHP, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and application
 crash) via a long e-mail address string, a related issue to CVE-2010-3710.

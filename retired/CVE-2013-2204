Description:
 moxieplayer.as in Moxiecode moxieplayer, as used in the TinyMCE Media
 plugin in WordPress before 3.5.2 and other products, does not consider the
 presence of a # (pound sign) character during extraction of the
 QUERY_STRING, which allows remote attackers to pass arbitrary parameters to
 a Flash application, and conduct content-spoofing attacks, via a crafted
 string after a ? (question mark) character.

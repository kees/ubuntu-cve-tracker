Description:
 The MoofParser::Metadata function in binding/MoofParser.cpp in
 libstagefright in Mozilla Firefox before 44.0 does not limit the size of
 read operations, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (integer overflow and buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via crafted metadata.

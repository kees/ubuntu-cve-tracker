 https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-720-1
Description:
 PHP 5 before 5.2.7 does not properly initialize the page_uid and page_gid
 global variables for use by the SAPI php_getuid function, which allows
 context-dependent attackers to bypass safe_mode restrictions via variable
 settings that are intended to be restricted to root, as demonstrated by a
 setting of /etc for the error_log variable.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> the second upstream patch is for apache 1.x sapi
 mdeslaur> apache 1.x is still in Dapper, so we better include it

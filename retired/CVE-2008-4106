Description:
 WordPress before 2.6.2 does not properly handle MySQL warnings about
 insertion of username strings that exceed the maximum column width of the
 user_login column, and does not properly handle space characters when
 comparing usernames, which allows remote attackers to change an arbitrary
 user's password to a random value by registering a similar username and
 then requesting a password reset, related to a "SQL column truncation
 vulnerability." NOTE: the attacker can discover the random password by also
 exploiting CVE-2008-4107.

Description:
 In Amanda 3.5.1, an information leak vulnerability was found in the
 calcsize SUID binary. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to know if a
 directory exists or not anywhere in the fs. The binary will use `opendir()`
 as root directly without checking the path, letting the attacker provide an
 arbitrary path.

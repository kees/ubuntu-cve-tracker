Description:
 Integer overflow in the MP4_ReadBox_rdrf function in libmp4.c for VLC
 0.8.6e allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted MP4 RDRF box that triggers a
 heap-based buffer overflow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-0984.

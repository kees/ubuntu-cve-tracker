Description:
 Apache Tomcat 6.0.0 through 6.0.15 processes parameters in the context of
 the wrong request when an exception occurs during parameter processing,
 which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, as
 demonstrated by disconnecting during this processing in order to trigger
 the exception.

Description:
 A flaw was found in Open vSwitch that allows ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisement
 packets between virtual machines to bypass OpenFlow rules. This issue may
 allow a local attacker to create specially crafted packets with a modified
 or spoofed target IP address field that can redirect ICMPv6 traffic to
 arbitrary IP addresses.

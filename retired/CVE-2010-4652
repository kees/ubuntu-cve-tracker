Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the sql_prepare_where function
 (contrib/mod_sql.c) in ProFTPD before 1.3.3d, when mod_sql is enabled,
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted username containing substitution tags,
 which are not properly handled during construction of an SQL query.

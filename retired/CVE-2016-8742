Description:
 The Windows installer that the Apache CouchDB team provides was vulnerable
 to local privilege escalation. All files in the install inherit the file
 permissions of the parent directory and therefore a non-privileged user can
 substitute any executable for the nssm.exe service launcher, or CouchDB
 batch or binary files. A subsequent service or server restart will then run
 that binary with administrator privilege. This issue affected CouchDB 2.0.0
 (Windows platform only) and was addressed in CouchDB 2.0.0.1.

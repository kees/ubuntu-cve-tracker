Description:
 It was found that when the nsslapd-unhashed-pw-switch 389 Directory Server
 configuration option was set to "off", it did not prevent the writing of
 unhashed passwords into the Changelog. This could potentially allow an
 authenticated user able to access the Changelog to read sensitive
 information.

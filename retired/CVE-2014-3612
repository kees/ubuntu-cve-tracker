Description:
 The LDAPLoginModule implementation in the Java Authentication and
 Authorization Service (JAAS) in Apache ActiveMQ 5.x before 5.10.1 allows
 remote attackers to bypass authentication by logging in with an empty
 password and valid username, which triggers an unauthenticated bind. NOTE:
 this identifier has been SPLIT per ADT2 due to different vulnerability
 types. See CVE-2015-6524 for the use of wildcard operators in usernames.

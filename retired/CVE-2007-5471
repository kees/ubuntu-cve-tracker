Description:
 libgssapi before 0.6-13.7, as used by the ISC BIND named daemon in SUSE
 Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP 1, terminates upon an initialization error,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon exit)
 via a GSS-TSIG request.  NOTE: this issue probably affects other daemons
 that attempt to initialize this library within a chroot configuration or
 other invalid configuration.

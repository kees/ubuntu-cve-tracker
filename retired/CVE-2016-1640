Description:
 The Web Store inline-installer implementation in the Extensions UI in
 Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.75 does not block installations upon
 deletion of an installation frame, which makes it easier for remote
 attackers to trick a user into believing that an installation request
 originated from the user's next navigation target via a crafted web site.

Description:
 The Extbase Framework in TYPO3 4.6.x through 4.6.6, 4.7, and 6.0
 unserializes untrusted data, which allows remote attackers to unserialize
 arbitrary objects and possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related
 to "a missing signature (HMAC) for a request argument."

 To our knowledge it is neither possible to inject code through this
 vulnerability, nor are there exploitable objects within the TYPO3 Core.
 However, there might be exploitable objects within third party extensions.

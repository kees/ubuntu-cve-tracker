Description:
 OCaml 3.12.1 and earlier computes hash values without restricting the
 ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
 via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> New randomization turned off by default and must be specifically
 mdeslaur> turned on by application. See upstream bug report.
 mdeslaur> Downgrading severity to low, since upstream won't change default
 mdeslaur> behaviour.

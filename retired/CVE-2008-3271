Description:
 Apache Tomcat 5.5.0 and 4.1.0 through 4.1.31 allows remote attackers to
 bypass an IP address restriction and obtain sensitive information via a
 request that is processed concurrently with another request but in a
 different thread, leading to an instance-variable overwrite associated with
 a "synchronization problem" and lack of thread safety, and related to
 RemoteFilterValve, RemoteAddrValve, and RemoteHostValve.

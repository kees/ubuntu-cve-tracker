Description:
 An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way the glibc's readdir_r()
 function handled file system entries longer than the NAME_MAX character
 constant. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted NTFS or CIFS
 file system that, when processed by an application using readdir_r(), would
 cause that application to crash or, potentially, allow the attacker to
 execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
 application.

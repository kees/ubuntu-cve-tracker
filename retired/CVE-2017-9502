Description:
 In curl before 7.54.1 on Windows and DOS, libcurl's default protocol
 function, which is the logic that allows an application to set which
 protocol libcurl should attempt to use when given a URL without a scheme
 part, had a flaw that could lead to it overwriting a heap based memory
 buffer with seven bytes. If the default protocol is specified to be FILE or
 a file: URL lacks two slashes, the given "URL" starts with a drive letter,
 and libcurl is built for Windows or DOS, then libcurl would copy the path 7
 bytes off, so that the end of the given path would write beyond the malloc
 buffer (7 bytes being the length in bytes of the ascii string "file://").

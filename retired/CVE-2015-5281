Description:
 It was discovered that grub2 builds for EFI systems contained modules that
 were not suitable to be loaded in a Secure Boot environment. An attacker
 could use this flaw to circumvent the Secure Boot mechanisms and load
 non-verified code. Attacks could use the boot menu if no password was set,
 or the grub2 configuration file if the attacker has root privileges on the
 system.

Description:
 flower.initd in the Gentoo dev-python/flower package before 0.9.1-r1 for
 Celery Flower sets PID file ownership to a non-root account, which might
 allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this
 non-root account for PID file modification before a root script executes a
 "kill `cat /pathname`" command.

Description:
 Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin
 permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which
 might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access
 restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a
 symlinked shared mailbox.

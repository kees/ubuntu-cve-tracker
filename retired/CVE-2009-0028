Description:
 The clone system call in the Linux kernel 2.6.28 and earlier allows local
 users to send arbitrary signals to a parent process from an unprivileged
 child process by launching an additional child process with the
 CLONE_PARENT flag, and then letting this new process exit.
Ubuntu-Description:
 In certain situations, cloned processes were able to send signals to parent
 processes, crossing privilege boundaries.  A local attacker could send
 arbitrary signals to parent processes, leading to a denial of service.

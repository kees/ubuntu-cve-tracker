Description:
 Previously, Puppet operated on a model that a node with a valid certificate
 was entitled to all information in the system and that a compromised
 certificate allowed access to everything in the infrastructure. When a
 node's catalog falls back to the `default` node, the catalog can be
 retrieved for a different node by modifying facts for the Puppet run. This
 issue can be mitigated by setting `strict_hostname_checking = true` in
 `puppet.conf` on your Puppet master. Puppet 6.13.0 and 5.5.19 changes the
 default behavior for strict_hostname_checking from false to true. It is
 recommended that Puppet Open Source and Puppet Enterprise users that are
 not upgrading still set strict_hostname_checking to true to ensure secure
 behavior. Affected software versions: Puppet 6.x prior to 6.13.0 Puppet
 Agent 6.x prior to 6.13.0 Puppet 5.5.x prior to 5.5.19 Puppet Agent 5.5.x
 prior to 5.5.19 Resolved in: Puppet 6.13.0 Puppet Agent 6.13.0 Puppet
 5.5.19 Puppet Agent 5.5.19

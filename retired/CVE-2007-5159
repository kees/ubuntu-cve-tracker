 The ntfs-3g package before 1.913-2.fc7 in Fedora 7, and an ntfs-3g package
 in Ubuntu 7.10/Gutsy, assign incorrect permissions (setuid root) to
 mount.ntfs-3g, which allows local users with fuse group membership to read
 from and write to arbitrary block devices, possibly involving a file
 descriptor leak.

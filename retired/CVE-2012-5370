Description:
 JRuby computes hash values without properly restricting the ability to
 trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent
 attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input
 to an application that maintains a hash table, as demonstrated by a
 universal multicollision attack against the MurmurHash2 algorithm, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4838.

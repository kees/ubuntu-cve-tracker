 http://marc.info/?l=apache-httpd-announce&m=146773096321832&w=2
Description:
 The Apache HTTP Server 2.4.18 through 2.4.20, when mod_http2 and mod_ssl
 are enabled, does not properly recognize the "SSLVerifyClient require"
 directive for HTTP/2 request authorization, which allows remote attackers
 to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the ability to send
 multiple requests over a single connection and aborting a renegotiation.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> advisory says introduced in 2.4.18

Description:
 Mort Bay Jetty 6.x through 6.1.22 and 7.0.0 writes backtrace data without
 sanitizing non-printable characters, which might allow remote attackers to
 modify a window's title, or possibly execute arbitrary commands or
 overwrite files, via an HTTP request containing an escape sequence for a
 terminal emulator, related to (1) a string value in the Age parameter to
 the default URI for the Cookie Dump Servlet in
 test-jetty-webapp/src/main/java/com/acme/CookieDump.java under cookie/, (2)
 an alphabetic value in the A parameter to jsp/expr.jsp, or (3) an
 alphabetic value in the Content-Length HTTP header to an arbitrary
 application.

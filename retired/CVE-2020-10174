Description:
 init_tmp in TeeJee.FileSystem.vala in Timeshift before 20.03 unsafely
 reuses a preexisting temporary directory in the predictable location
 /tmp/timeshift. It follows symlinks in this location or uses directories
 owned by unprivileged users. Because Timeshift also executes scripts under
 this location, an attacker can attempt to win a race condition to replace
 scripts created by Timeshift with attacker-controlled scripts. Upon
 success, an attacker-controlled script is executed with full root
 privileges. This logic is practically always triggered when Timeshift runs
 regardless of the command-line arguments used.

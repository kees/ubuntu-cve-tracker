Description:
 SQL injection vulnerability in graph.php in Cacti 0.8.7e and earlier allows
 remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via a crafted rra_id
 parameter in a GET request in conjunction with a valid rra_id value in a
 POST request or a cookie, which causes the POST or cookie value to bypass
 the validation routine, but inserts the $_GET value into the resulting
 query.

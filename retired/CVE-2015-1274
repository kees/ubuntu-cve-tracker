Description:
 Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89 does not ensure that the auto-open list
 omits all dangerous file types, which makes it easier for remote attackers
 to execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted file and leveraging a
 user's previous "Always open files of this type" choice, related to
 download_commands.cc and download_prefs.cc.

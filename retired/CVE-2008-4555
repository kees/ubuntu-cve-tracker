 Stack-based buffer overflow in the push_subg function in parser.y
 (lib/graph/parser.c) in Graphviz 2.20.2, and possibly earlier versions,
 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 corruption) or execute arbitrary code via a DOT file with a large number of
 Agraph_t elements.

Description:
 OpenSSL before 1.0.0c, when J-PAKE is enabled, does not properly validate
 the public parameters in the J-PAKE protocol, which allows remote attackers
 to bypass the need for knowledge of the shared secret, and successfully
 authenticate, by sending crafted values in each round of the protocol.

Description:
 The Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Mozilla Firefox before
 27.0 and SeaMonkey before 2.24 operates on XSLT stylesheets according to
 style-src directives instead of script-src directives, which might allow
 remote attackers to execute arbitrary XSLT code by leveraging insufficient
 style-src restrictions.

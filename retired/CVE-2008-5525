Description:
 ClamAV 0.94.1 and possibly 0.93.1, when Internet Explorer 6 or 7 is used,
 allows remote attackers to bypass detection of malware in an HTML document
 by placing an MZ header (aka "EXE info") at the beginning, and modifying
 the filename to have (1) no extension, (2) a .txt extension, or (3) a .jpg
 extension, as demonstrated by a document containing a CVE-2006-5745
 exploit.

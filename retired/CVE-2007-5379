Description:
 Rails before 1.2.4, as used for Ruby on Rails, allows remote attackers and
 ActiveResource servers to determine the existence of arbitrary files and
 read arbitrary XML files via the Hash.from_xml (Hash#from_xml) method,
 which uses XmlSimple (XML::Simple) unsafely, as demonstrated by reading
 passwords from the Pidgin (Gaim) .purple/accounts.xml file.

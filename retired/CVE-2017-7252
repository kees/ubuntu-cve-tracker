Description:
 Botan’s implementation of bcrypt password hashing scheme truncated long
 passwords at 56 characters, instead of at bcrypt’s standard 72 characters
 limit. Passwords with lengths between these two bounds could be cracked more
 easily than should be the case due to the final password bytes being ignored.

Description:
 If a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and then later set a master
 password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This
 is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was
 copied to a new format starting in Thunderbird 60. The new master password
 is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored
 password data outside of user expectations. This vulnerability affects
 Thunderbird < 68.5.

Description:
 The SelectionOwner::ProcessTarget function in ui/base/x/selection_owner.cc
 in the UI implementation in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91 uses an
 incorrect data type for a certain length value, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted X11
 data.

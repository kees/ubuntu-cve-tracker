Description:
 An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way libvirt's
 qemuDomainGetBlockIoTune() function looked up the disk index in a
 non-persistent (live) disk configuration while a persistent disk
 configuration was being indexed. A remote attacker able to establish a
 read-only connection to libvirtd could use this flaw to crash libvirtd or,
 potentially, leak memory from the libvirtd process.

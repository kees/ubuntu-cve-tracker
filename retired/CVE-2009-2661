Description:
 The asn1_length function in strongSwan 2.8 before 2.8.11, 4.2 before
 4.2.17, and 4.3 before 4.3.3 does not properly handle X.509 certificates
 with crafted Relative Distinguished Names (RDNs), which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (pluto IKE daemon crash) via
 malformed ASN.1 data.  NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2009-2185.

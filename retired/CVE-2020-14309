Description:
 There's an issue with grub2 in all versions before 2.06 when handling
 squashfs filesystems containing a symbolic link with name length of UINT32
 bytes in size. The name size leads to an arithmetic overflow leading to a
 zero-size allocation further causing a heap-based buffer overflow with
 attacker controlled data.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Chris Coulson discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in GRUB2
 when handling certain filesystems or font files, leading to heap-based
 buffer overflows. A local attacker could use these to execute arbitrary
 code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.
Notes: 
 amurray| grub2-signed is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (precise/esm)
  and so marking the priority for grub2 in this release as low

Description:
 An issue was discovered in Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) 2.4 as used in SVG++
 (aka svgpp) 1.2.3. A heap-based buffer overflow bug in svgpp_agg_render may
 lead to code execution. In the render_scanlines_aa_solid function, the
 blend_hline function is called repeatedly multiple times. blend_hline is
 equivalent to a loop containing write operations. Each call writes a piece
 of heap data, and multiple calls overwrite the data in the heap.

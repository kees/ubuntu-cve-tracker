Description:
 Directory traversal vulnerability in SQL-Ledger, and LedgerSMB before
 1.1.5, allows remote attackers to read and overwrite arbitrary files, and
 execute arbitrary code, via . (dot) characters adjacent to (1) users and
 (2) users/members strings, which are removed by blacklisting functions that
 filter these strings and collapse into .. (dot dot) sequences.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ebarretto> According to Debian:
 ebarretto> "It's documented behaviour that SQL-Ledger should only be run
 ebarretto> in an authenticated HTTP zone and without untrusted users"
 ebarretto> Setting esm-apps/xenial to ignored

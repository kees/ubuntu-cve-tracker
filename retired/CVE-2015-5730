Description:
 The sanitize_widget_instance function in
 wp-includes/class-wp-customize-widgets.php in WordPress before 4.2.4 does
 not use a constant-time comparison for widgets, which allows remote
 attackers to conduct a timing side-channel attack by measuring the delay
 before inequality is calculated.

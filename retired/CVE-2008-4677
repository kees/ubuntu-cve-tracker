Description:
 autoload/netrw.vim (aka the Netrw Plugin) 109, 131, and other versions
 before 133k for Vim 7.1.266, other 7.1 versions, and 7.2 stores credentials
 for an FTP session, and sends those credentials when attempting to
 establish subsequent FTP sessions to servers on different hosts, which
 allows remote FTP servers to obtain sensitive information in opportunistic
 circumstances by logging usernames and passwords.  NOTE: the upstream
 vendor disputes a vector involving different ports on the same host,
 stating "I'm assuming that they're using the same id and password on that
 unchanged hostname, deliberately."

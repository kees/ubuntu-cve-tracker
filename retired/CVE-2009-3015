Description:
 QtWeb 3.0 Builds 001 and 003 does not properly block javascript: and data:
 URIs in Refresh and Location headers in HTTP responses, which allows remote
 attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related
 to (1) injecting a Refresh header that contains a javascript: URI, (2)
 entering a javascript: URI when specifying the content of a Refresh header,
 (3) injecting a Refresh header that contains JavaScript sequences in a
 data:text/html URI, (4) entering a data:text/html URI with JavaScript
 sequences when specifying the content of a Refresh header, (5) injecting a
 Location header that contains JavaScript sequences in a data:text/html URI,
 or (6) entering a data:text/html URI with JavaScript sequences when
 specifying the content of a Location header.

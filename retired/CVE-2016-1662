Description:
 extensions/renderer/gc_callback.cc in Google Chrome before 50.0.2661.94
 does not prevent fallback execution once the Garbage Collection callback
 has started, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
 vectors.

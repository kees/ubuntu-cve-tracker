Description:
 An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 15.x before 15.4.1. When
 connected to Asterisk via TCP/TLS, if the client abruptly disconnects, or
 sends a specially crafted message, then Asterisk gets caught in an infinite
 loop while trying to read the data stream. This renders the system
 unusable.

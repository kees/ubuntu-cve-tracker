Description:
 znc.cpp in ZNC before 0.092 allows remote authenticated users to cause a
 denial of service (crash) by requesting traffic statistics when there is an
 active unauthenticated connection, which triggers a NULL pointer
 dereference, as demonstrated using (1) a traffic link in the web
 administration pages or (2) the traffic command in the /znc shell.

 sbeattie> debian's CVE tracker for some reason references gitolite with
  this CVE; I think it's an editing mistake.
 mdeslaur> this is actually a typo. CVE-2010-2488 is the actual CVE number.

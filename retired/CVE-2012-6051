Description:
 Google CityHash computes hash values without properly restricting the
 ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
 via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table, as
 demonstrated by a universal multicollision attack.

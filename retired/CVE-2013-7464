 http://repo.or.cz/csrf-magic.git/commit/9d2537f70d58b16aeba89779aaf1573b8d618e11
Description:
 In csrf-magic before 1.0.4, if $GLOBALS['csrf']['secret'] is not
 configured, the Anti-CSRF Token used is predictable and would permit an
 attacker to bypass the CSRF protections, because an automatically generated
 secret is not used.

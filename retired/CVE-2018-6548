Description:
 A use-after-free issue was discovered in libwebm through 2018-02-02. If a
 Vp9HeaderParser was initialized once before, its property frame_ would not
 be changed because of code in vp9parser::Vp9HeaderParser::SetFrame. Its
 frame_ could be freed while the corresponding pointer would not be updated,
 leading to a dangling pointer. This is related to the function
 OutputCluster in webm_info.cc.

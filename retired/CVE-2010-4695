Description:
 A certain Fedora patch for gif2png.c in gif2png 2.5.1 and 2.5.2, as
 distributed in gif2png-2.5.1-1200.fc12 on Fedora 12 and gif2png_2.5.2-1 on
 Debian GNU/Linux, truncates a GIF pathname specified on the command line,
 which might allow remote attackers to create PNG files in unintended
 directories via a crafted command-line argument, as demonstrated by a CGI
 program that launches gif2png, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2009-5018.

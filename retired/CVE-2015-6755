Description:
 The ContainerNode::parserInsertBefore function in
 core/dom/ContainerNode.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
 46.0.2490.71, proceeds with a DOM tree insertion in certain cases where a
 parent node no longer contains a child node, which allows remote attackers
 to bypass the Same Origin Policy via crafted JavaScript code.

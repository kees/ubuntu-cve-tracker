 Multiple integer overflows in Xpdf 2.x and 3.x and Poppler 0.x, as used in
 the pdftops filter in CUPS 1.1.17, 1.1.22, and 1.3.7, GPdf, and kdegraphics
 KPDF, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file that
 triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, possibly related to (1) Decrypt.cxx,
 (2) FoFiTrueType.cxx, (3) gmem.c, (4) JBIG2Stream.cxx, and (5)
 PSOutputDev.cxx in pdftops/. NOTE: the JBIG2Stream.cxx vector may overlap

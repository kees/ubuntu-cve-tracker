Description:
 The decrypt_public function in lib/crypt.cpp in the client in Berkeley Open
 Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) 6.2.14 and 6.4.5 does not
 check the return value from the OpenSSL RSA_public_decrypt function, which
 allows remote attackers to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a
 malformed SSL/TLS signature, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.

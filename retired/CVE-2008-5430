Description:
 Mozilla Thunderbird 2.0.14 does not properly handle (1) multipart/mixed
 e-mail messages with many MIME parts and possibly (2) e-mail messages with
 many "Content-type: message/rfc822;" headers, which might allow remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption or other resource
 consumption) via a large e-mail message, a related issue to CVE-2006-1173.

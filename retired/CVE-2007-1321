Candidate: CVE-2007-1321

Description:
 Integer signedness error in the NE2000 emulator in QEMU 0.8.2, as used in
 Xen and possibly other products, allows local users to trigger a heap-based
 buffer overflow via certain register values that bypass sanity checks, aka
 QEMU NE2000 "receive" integer signedness error. NOTE: this identifier was
 inadvertently used by some sources to cover multiple issues that were
 labeled "NE2000 network driver and the socket code," but separate
 identifiers have been created for the individual vulnerabilities since
 there are sometimes different fixes; see CVE-2007-5729 and CVE-2007-5730.

Description:
 The show_elog_list function in elogd.c in elog 2.6.2 and earlier allows
 remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by
 attempting to access a logbook whose name begins with "global," which
 results in a NULL pointer dereference.  NOTE: some of these details are
 obtained from third party information.

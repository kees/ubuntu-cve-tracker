Description:
 Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) libFLAC before 1.2.1 allows user-assisted
 remote attackers to force a client to download arbitrary files via the
 MIME-Type URL flag (-->) for the FLAC image file in a crafted .FLAC file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> checked diff from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1 and found the mime parts. These
   were included in the fix for CVE-2007-4619 for gutsy. 1.1.2 does not
   have the mime code in libFLAC
 jdstrand> note that CVE-2007-4619 was very general and came out before the
   iDefense CVEs, so there is overlap

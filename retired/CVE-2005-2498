 Eval injection vulnerability in PHPXMLRPC 1.1.1 and earlier (PEAR XML-RPC
 for PHP), as used in multiple products including (1) Drupal, (2) phpAdsNew,
 (3) phpPgAds, and (4) phpgroupware, allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary PHP code via certain nested XML tags in a PHP document that
 should not be nested, which are injected into an eval function call, a

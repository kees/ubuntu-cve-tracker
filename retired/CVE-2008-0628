Description:
 The XML parsing code in Sun Java Runtime Environment JDK and JRE 6 Update 3
 and earlier processes external entity references even when the "external
 general entities" property is false, which allows remote attackers to
 conduct XML external entity (XXE) attacks and cause a denial of service or
 access restricted resources.

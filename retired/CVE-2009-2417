Description:
 CVE-2009-2417 curl: incorrect verification of SSL certificate with NUL in
 name
Ubuntu-Description:
 sbeattie> hardy's patch for this issue was added to the end of the
 quilt series; unfortunately, the build system is quirky and pushes
 up patches by a name, thus the patch for this was not getting applied
 at build time. Fixed in usn-1158-1.

Description:
 WordPress and WordPress MU before 2.8.1 exhibit different behavior for a
 failed login attempt depending on whether the user account exists, which
 allows remote attackers to enumerate valid usernames.  NOTE: the vendor
 reportedly disputes the significance of this issue, indicating that the
 behavior exists for "user convenience."

Description:
 main/java/com/ning/http/client/AsyncHttpClientConfig.java in Async Http
 Client (aka AHC or async-http-client) before 1.9.0 does not require a
 hostname match during verification of X.509 certificates, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof HTTPS servers via an arbitrary valid
 certificate.

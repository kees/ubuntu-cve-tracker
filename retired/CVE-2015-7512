Description:
 A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU's AMD PC-Net II emulation
 validated certain received packets from a remote host in non-loopback mode.
 A remote, unprivileged attacker could potentially use this flaw to execute
 arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process. Note
 that to exploit this flaw, the guest network interface must have a large
 MTU limit.

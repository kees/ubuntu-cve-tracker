Description:
 The UnescapeURLWithOffsetsImpl function in net/base/escape.cc in Google
 Chrome before 34.0.1847.116 does not properly handle bidirectional
 Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), which makes it easier for
 remote attackers to spoof URLs via crafted use of right-to-left (RTL)
 Unicode text.

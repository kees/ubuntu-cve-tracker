Description:
 Use-after-free vulnerability in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
 38.0.2125.101, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code that
 triggers a widget-position update that improperly interacts with the render
 tree, related to the FrameView::updateLayoutAndStyleForPainting function in
 core/frame/FrameView.cpp and the RenderLayerScrollableArea::setScrollOffset
 function in core/rendering/RenderLayerScrollableArea.cpp.

Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8 when the
 append_domain setting is used (because the appended characters do not
 properly interact with hostname length restrictions). Due to incorrect
 message processing, it can inappropriately redirect traffic to origins it
 should not be delivered to.

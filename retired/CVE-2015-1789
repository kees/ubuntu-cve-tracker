Description:
 An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the X509_cmp_time() function of
 OpenSSL, which is used to test the expiry dates of SSL/TLS certificates. An
 attacker could possibly use a specially crafted SSL/TLS certificate or CRL
 (Certificate Revocation List), which when parsed by an application would
 cause that application to crash.

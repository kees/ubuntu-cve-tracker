Description:
 The vwr_read function in wiretap/vwr.c in the Ixia IxVeriWave file parser
 in Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.8 does not validate the relationship between
 a record length and a trailer length, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application
 crash) via a crafted packet.

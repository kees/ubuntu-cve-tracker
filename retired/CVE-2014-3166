Description:
 The Public Key Pinning (PKP) implementation in Google Chrome before
 36.0.1985.143 on Windows, OS X, and Linux, and before 36.0.1985.135 on
 Android, does not correctly consider the properties of SPDY connections,
 which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging
 the use of multiple domain names.

Description:
 The STARTTLS implementation in nnrpd in INN before 2.5.3 does not properly
 restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert
 commands into encrypted sessions by sending a cleartext command that is
 processed after TLS is in place, related to a "plaintext command injection"
 attack, a similar issue to CVE-2011-0411.

Description:
 An issue was discovered in the default FilterScheduler in OpenStack Nova
 16.0.3. By repeatedly rebuilding an instance with new images, an
 authenticated user may consume untracked resources on a hypervisor host
 leading to a denial of service, aka doubled resource allocations. This
 regression was introduced with the fix for OSSA-2017-005 (CVE-2017-16239);
 however, only Nova stable/pike or later deployments with that fix applied
 and relying on the default FilterScheduler are affected.

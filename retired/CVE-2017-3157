Description:
 By exploiting the way Apache OpenOffice before 4.1.4 renders embedded
 objects, an attacker could craft a document that allows reading in a file
 from the user's filesystem. Information could be retrieved by the attacker
 by, e.g., using hidden sections to store the information, tricking the user
 into saving the document and convincing the user to send the document back
 to the attacker. The vulnerability is mitigated by the need for the
 attacker to know the precise file path in the target system, and the need
 to trick the user into saving the document and sending it back.

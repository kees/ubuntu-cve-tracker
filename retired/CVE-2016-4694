Description:
 The Apache HTTP Server in Apple OS X before 10.12 and OS X Server before
 5.2 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect
 applications from the presence of untrusted CGI client data in the
 HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to
 redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy
 server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy"
 issue, a related issue to CVE-2016-5387.

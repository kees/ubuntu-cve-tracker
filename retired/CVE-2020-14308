Description:
 In grub2 versions before 2.06 the grub memory allocator doesn't check for
 possible arithmetic overflows on the requested allocation size. This leads
 the function to return invalid memory allocations which can be further used
 to cause possible integrity, confidentiality and availability impacts
 during the boot process.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that the memory allocator for GRUB2 did not validate
 allocation size, resulting in multiple integer overflows and heap-based
 buffer overflows when handling certain filesystems, PNG images or disk
 metadata. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and
 bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.
Notes: 
 alexmurray| grub2-signed is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (precise/esm)

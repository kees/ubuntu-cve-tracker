Description:
 Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Help Contents
 web application (aka the Help Server) in Eclipse IDE, possibly 3.3.2, allow
 remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the
 searchWord parameter to help/advanced/searchView.jsp or (2) the workingSet
 parameter in an add action to help/advanced/workingSetManager.jsp, a
 different issue than CVE-2010-4647.

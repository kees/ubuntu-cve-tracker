Description:
 Composer before 2016-02-10 allows cache poisoning from other projects built
 on the same host. This results in attacker-controlled code entering a
 server-side build process. The issue occurs because of the way that dist
 packages are cached. The cache key is derived from the package name, the
 dist type, and certain other data from the package repository (which may
 simply be a commit hash, and thus can be found by an attacker). Versions
 through 1.0.0-alpha11 are affected, and 1.0.0 is unaffected.

 details when a message is unqueued, such as headers or arguments; (2)
 policy names, which are not properly handled when viewing policies; (3)
 details for AMQP network clients, such as the version; allow remote
 authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (4)
 user names, (5) the cluster name; or allow RabbitMQ cluster administrators
 to (6) modify unspecified content.

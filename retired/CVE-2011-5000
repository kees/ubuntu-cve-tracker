Description:
 The ssh_gssapi_parse_ename function in gss-serv.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and
 earlier, when gssapi-with-mic authentication is enabled, allows remote
 authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a
 large value in a certain length field.  NOTE: there may be limited
 scenarios in which this issue is relevant.

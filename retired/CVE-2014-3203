Description:
 Unity before 7.2.1, as used in Ubuntu 14.04, does not properly restrict
 access to the Dash when the lock screen is active, which allows physically
 proximate attackers to bypass the lock screen and execute arbitrary
 commands, as demonstrated by pressing the SUPER key before the screen
 auto-locks.

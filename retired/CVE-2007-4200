Description:
 ntfs.c in fsstat in Brian Carrier The Sleuth Kit (TSK) before 2.09
 interprets a certain variable as a byte count rather than a count of 32-bit
 integers, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (application crash) and prevent examination of certain NTFS files
 via a malformed NTFS image.

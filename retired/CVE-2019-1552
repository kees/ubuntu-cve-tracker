Description:
 OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a
 configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS.
 This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is
 configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options. For
 OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume
 that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like
 environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for
 OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs are Windows
 programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of
 'C:/usr/local', which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
 to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify
 (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2,
 '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows
 targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for
 the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own
 --prefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this
 issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been
 assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at
 this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in
 OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected
 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

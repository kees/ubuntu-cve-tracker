Description:
 LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed
 macros can be executed on various script events such as mouse-over,
 document-open etc. Access is intended to be restricted to scripts under the
 share/Scripts/python, user/Scripts/python sub-directories of the
 LibreOffice install. Protection was added, to address CVE-2019-9852, to
 avoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations on
 the file system could be executed by employing a URL encoding attack to
 defeat the path verification step. However this protection could be
 bypassed by taking advantage of a flaw in how LibreOffice assembled the
 final script URL location directly from components of the passed in path as
 opposed to solely from the sanitized output of the path verification step.
 This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice 6.2 versions prior to
 6.2.7; 6.3 versions prior to 6.3.1.

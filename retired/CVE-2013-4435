Notes:
 seth-arnold> The announce notes are too difficult to decipher to discover which
  patches go with which vulnerabilities; there are also some duplicated CVEs
  and CVE-2013-4437 isn't even mentioned at all,, which makes me think the
  whole annoucement needs a salt expert to revisit and revise.

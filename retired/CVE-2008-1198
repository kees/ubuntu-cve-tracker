Description:
 The default IPSec ifup script in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 through 5
 configures racoon to use aggressive IKE mode instead of main IKE mode,
 which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute force attacks
 by sniffing an unencrypted preshared key (PSK) hash.

Notes:
 jdstrand> not affected on Ubuntu as racoon.conf does not ship with this and
   has in its commented out section 'exchange_mode main,aggressive'

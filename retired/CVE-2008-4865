Description:
 Untrusted search path vulnerability in valgrind before 3.4.0 allows local
 users to execute arbitrary programs via a Trojan horse .valgrindrc file in
 the current working directory, as demonstrated using a malicious

 but CVE is including this issue because execution of a program from an
 untrusted directory is a common scenario.

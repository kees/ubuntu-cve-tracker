Description:
 Martin Lambers mpop before 1.0.19, when OpenSSL is used, does not properly
 handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the (1) subject's Common Name
 or (2) Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted
 certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue
 to CVE-2009-2408.

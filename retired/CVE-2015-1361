Description:
 platform/image-decoders/ImageFrame.h in Blink, as used in Google Chrome
 before 40.0.2214.91, does not initialize a variable that is used in calls
 to the Skia SkBitmap::setAlphaType function, which might allow remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a crafted HTML document, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2015-1205.

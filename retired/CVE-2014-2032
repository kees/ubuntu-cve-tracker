Description:
 Deadwood before 2.3.09, 3.x before 3.2.05, and as used in MaraDNS before
 1.4.14 and 2.x before 2.0.09, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (out-of-bounds read and crash) by leveraging permission to perform
 recursive queries against Deadwood, related to missing input validation.

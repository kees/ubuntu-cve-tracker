Description:
 The RuntimeHelpers.InitializeArray method in metadata/icall.c in Mono, when
 Moonlight 2.x before 2.4.1 or 3.x before 3.99.3 is used, does not properly
 restrict data types, which allows remote attackers to modify internal
 read-only data structures, and cause a denial of service (plugin crash) or
 corrupt the internal state of the security manager, via a crafted media
 file, as demonstrated by modifying a C# struct.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> upstream note: The bug (and fix) is in mono source code but can
 mdeslaur> only be exploited (by untrusted applications) when used by
 mdeslaur> Moonlight.
 mdeslaur> Setting severity to negligible.
 jdstrand> 2.10.5-1 has the fixes in source

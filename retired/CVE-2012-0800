Description:
 The form-autocompletion functionality in Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.7, 2.1.x
 before 2.1.4, and 2.2.x before 2.2.1 makes it easier for physically
 proximate attackers to discover passwords by reading the contents of a
 non-password field, as demonstrated by accessing a create-groups page with
 Safari on an iPad device.

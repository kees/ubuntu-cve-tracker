Description:
 pam_krb5 2.2.14 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and earlier, when the
 existing_ticket option is enabled, uses incorrect privileges when reading a
 Kerberos credential cache, which allows local users to gain privileges by
 setting the KRB5CCNAME environment variable to an arbitrary cache filename
 and running the (1) su or (2) sudo program. NOTE: there may be a related
 vector involving sshd that has limited relevance.

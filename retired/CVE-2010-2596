Description:
 The OJPEGPostDecode function in tif_ojpeg.c in LibTIFF 3.9.0 and 3.9.2, as
 used in tiff2ps, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (assertion failure and application exit) via a crafted TIFF image, related
 to "downsampled OJPEG input."
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> RedHat claims this is fixed by RHSA-2014-0222, no specific
 mdeslaur> patch though, so one of the patches for other CVEs must have
 mdeslaur> fixed it at the same time.
 mdeslaur> cannot reproduce on quantal+
 mdeslaur> also check for missing parts of CVE-2014-8127 and CVE-2014-8128
 mdeslaur> this will not be fixed in precise/esm

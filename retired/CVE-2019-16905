Description:
 OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an
 experimental key type, has a pre-authentication integer overflow if a
 client or server is configured to use a crafted XMSS key. This leads to
 memory corruption and local code execution because of an error in the XMSS
 key parsing algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered
 experimental in all released OpenSSH versions, and there is no supported
 way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.

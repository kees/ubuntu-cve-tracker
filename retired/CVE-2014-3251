Description:
 The MCollective aes_security plugin, as used in Puppet Enterprise before
 3.3.0 and Mcollective before 2.5.3, does not properly validate new server
 certificates based on the CA certificate, which allows local users to
 establish unauthorized Mcollective connections via unspecified vectors
 related to a race condition.

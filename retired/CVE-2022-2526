Description:
 A use-after-free vulnerability was found in systemd. This issue occurs due
 to the on_stream_io() function and dns_stream_complete() function in
 'resolved-dns-stream.c' not incrementing the reference counting for the
 DnsStream object. Therefore, other functions and callbacks called can
 dereference the DNSStream object, causing the use-after-free when the
 reference is still used later.

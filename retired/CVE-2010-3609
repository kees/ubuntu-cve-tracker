Description:
 The extension parser in slp_v2message.c in OpenSLP 1.2.1, and other
 versions before SVN revision 1647, as used in Service Location Protocol
 daemon (SLPD) in VMware ESX 4.0 and 4.1 and ESXi 4.0 and 4.1, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a packet with a
 "next extension offset" that references this extension or a previous
 extension.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
 information.

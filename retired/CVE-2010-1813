 WebKit in Apple iOS before 4.1 on the iPhone and iPod touch allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory
 corruption and application crash) via vectors involving HTML object
 outlines.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> qt4-x11 unmaintained upstream (see README.webkit for details)
 jdstrand> webkit is a fork of khtml from kdelibs. kdelibs5 is farther from
  it, while qt4-x11 attempts to unify khtml and webkit.
 mdeslaur> webkitkde is a wrapper around qt4-x11's webkit.
 sbeattie> debian claims this is a duplicate of CVE-2010-1782
 mdeslaur> doesn't appear to be a dupe of CVE-2010-1782, and not in 1.2.5

Description:
 Tor before 0.2.2.34, when configured as a client or bridge, sends a TLS
 certificate chain as part of an outgoing OR connection, which allows remote
 relays to bypass intended anonymity properties by reading this chain and
 then determining the set of entry guards that the client or bridge had
 selected.

Description:
 It was found that the amsvis command of the powerpc-utils-python package
 did not verify unpickled data before processing it. This could allow an
 attacker who can connect to an amsvis server process (or cause an amsvis
 client process to connect to them) to execute arbitrary code as the user
 running the amsvis process.

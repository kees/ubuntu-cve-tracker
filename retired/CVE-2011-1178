Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in the load_image function in file-pcx.c in the
 Personal Computer Exchange (PCX) plugin in GIMP 2.6.x and earlier allow
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PCX image that triggers a
 heap-based buffer overflow.

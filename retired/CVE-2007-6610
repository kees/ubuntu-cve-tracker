Description:
 unp 1.0.12, and other versions before 1.0.14, does not properly escape file
 names, which might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary
 commands via shell metacharacters in a filename argument. NOTE: this might
 only be a vulnerability when unp is invoked by a third party product.

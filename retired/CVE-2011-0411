Description:
 The STARTTLS implementation in Postfix 2.4.x before 2.4.16, 2.5.x before
 2.5.12, 2.6.x before 2.6.9, and 2.7.x before 2.7.3 does not properly
 restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert
 commands into encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext command that
 is processed after TLS is in place, related to a "plaintext command
 injection" attack.

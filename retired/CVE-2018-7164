Description:
 Node.js versions 9.7.0 and later and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity
 is MEDIUM. A bug introduced in 9.7.0 increases the memory consumed when
 reading from the network into JavaScript using the net.Socket object
 directly as a stream. An attacker could use this cause a denial of service
 by sending tiny chunks of data in short succession. This vulnerability was
 restored by reverting to the prior behaviour.

Description:
 Java Web Start in Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 2 and earlier, JDK and JRE 5.0
 Update 12 and earlier, and SDK and JRE 1.4.2_15 and earlier does not
 properly enforce access restrictions for untrusted applications, which
 allows user-assisted remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (the
 Java Web Start cache location) via an untrusted application, aka "three
 vulnerabilities."

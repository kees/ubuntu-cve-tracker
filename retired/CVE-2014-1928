Description:
 The shell_quote function in python-gnupg 0.3.5 does not properly escape
 characters, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary
 code via shell metacharacters in unspecified vectors, as demonstrated using
 "\" (backslash) characters to form multi-command sequences, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2014-1927.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because
 of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7323.

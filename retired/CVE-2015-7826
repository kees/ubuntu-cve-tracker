Description:
 botan 1.11.x before 1.11.22 improperly handles wildcard matching against
 hostnames, which might allow remote attackers to have unspecified impact
 via a valid X.509 certificate, as demonstrated by accepting *.example.com
 as a match for bar.foo.example.com.

 Otherwise valid certificates using wildcards would be accepted as
 matching certain hostnames that should they should not according to
 RFC 6125. For example a certificate issued for ‘*.example.com’
 should match ‘foo.example.com’ but not ‘example.com’ or
 ‘bar.foo.example.com’. Previously Botan would accept such a
 certificate as valid for ‘bar.foo.example.com’.

 RFC 6125 also requires that when matching a X.509 certificate against
 a DNS name, the CN entry is only compared if no subjectAlternativeName
 entry is available. Previously X509_Certificate::matches_dns_name would
 always check both names.

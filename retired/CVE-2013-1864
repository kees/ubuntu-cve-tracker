Description:
 The Portable Tool Library (aka PTLib) before 2.10.10, as used in Ekiga
 before 4.0.1, does not properly detect recursion during entity expansion,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU
 consumption) via a crafted PXML document containing a large number of
 nested entity references, aka a "billion laughs attack."

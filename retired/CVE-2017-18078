Description:
 systemd-tmpfiles in systemd before 237 attempts to support
 ownership/permission changes on hardlinked files even if the
 fs.protected_hardlinks sysctl is turned off, which allows local users to
 bypass intended access restrictions via vectors involving a hard link to a
 file for which the user lacks write access, as demonstrated by changing the
 ownership of the /etc/passwd file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ratliff> mitigated by fs.protected_hardlinks = 1
 mdeslaur> patch simply refuses to set hardlink file permissions if the
 mdeslaur> kernel hardening feature is turned off, which may result in
 mdeslaur> breakage. We will not be releasing an update for this issue as
 mdeslaur> our default configuration is not vulnerable.

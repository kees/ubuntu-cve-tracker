Description:
 An issue was discovered in Cobbler before 3.3.1. Files in /etc/cobbler are
 world readable. Two of those files contain some sensitive information that
 can be exposed to a local user who has non-privileged access to the server.
 The users.digest file contains the sha2-512 digest of users in a Cobbler
 local installation. In the case of an easy-to-guess password, it's trivial
 to obtain the plaintext string. The settings.yaml file contains secrets
 such as the hashed default password.

Description:
 functions/imap_general.php in SquirrelMail before 1.4.21 does not properly
 handle 8-bit characters in passwords, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by making many IMAP login
 attempts with different usernames, leading to the creation of many
 preferences files.

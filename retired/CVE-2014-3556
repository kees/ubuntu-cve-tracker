Description:
 The STARTTLS implementation in mail/ngx_mail_smtp_handler.c in the SMTP
 proxy in nginx 1.5.x and 1.6.x before 1.6.1 and 1.7.x before 1.7.4 does not
 properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
 to insert commands into encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext
 command that is processed after TLS is in place, related to a "plaintext
 command injection" attack, a similar issue to CVE-2011-0411.

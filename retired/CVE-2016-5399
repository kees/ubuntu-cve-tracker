Description:
 A flaw was found in the way certain error conditions were handled by
 bzread() function in PHP. An attacker could use this flaw to upload a
 specially crafted bz2 archive which, when parsed via the vulnerable
 function, could cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code
 with the permissions of the user running the PHP application.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> PHP position seems to suggest they'll fix bzread() to ensure
  it conforms to the documented behaviour but they won't take any steps
  to 'safe' an improper use of API by applications. Since the API was
  apparently not honoured before I don't know how an application could be
  expected to be correct.

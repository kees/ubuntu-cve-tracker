Description:
 GitLab versions 8.9.x and above contain a critical security flaw in the
 "import/export project" feature of GitLab. Added in GitLab 8.9, this
 feature allows a user to export and then re-import their projects as tape
 archive files (tar). All GitLab versions prior to 8.13.0 restricted this
 feature to administrators only. Starting with version 8.13.0 this feature
 was made available to all users. This feature did not properly check for
 symbolic links in user-provided archives and therefore it was possible for
 an authenticated user to retrieve the contents of any file accessible to
 the GitLab service account. This included sensitive files such as those
 that contain secret tokens used by the GitLab service to authenticate
 users. GitLab CE and EE versions 8.13.0 through 8.13.2, 8.12.0 through
 8.12.7, 8.11.0 through 8.11.10, 8.10.0 through 8.10.12, and 8.9.0 through
 8.9.11 are affected.

Description:
 Bugzilla 3.2.1, 3.0.7, and 3.3.2, when running under mod_perl, calls the
 srand function at startup time, which causes Apache children to have the
 same seed and produce insufficiently random numbers for random tokens,
 which allows remote attackers to bypass cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
 protection mechanisms and conduct unauthorized activities as other users.

Description:
 Mozilla Firefox, possibly before 3.6, allows remote attackers to discover a
 redirect's target URL, for the session of a specific user of a web site, by
 placing the site's URL in the HREF attribute of a stylesheet LINK element,
 and then reading the document.styleSheets[0].href property value, related
 to an IFRAME element.

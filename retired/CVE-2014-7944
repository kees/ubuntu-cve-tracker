Description:
 The sycc422_to_rgb function in fxcodec/codec/fx_codec_jpx_opj.cpp in
 PDFium, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, does not properly
 handle odd values of image width, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted PDF document.

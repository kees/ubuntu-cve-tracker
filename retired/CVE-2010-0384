Description:
 Tor 0.2.2.x before 0.2.2.7-alpha, when functioning as a directory mirror,
 does not prevent logging of the client IP address upon detection of
 erroneous client behavior, which might make it easier for local users to
 discover the identities of clients in opportunistic circumstances by
 reading log files.

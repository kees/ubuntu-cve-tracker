 Deployment). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u131, 7u121
 and 8u112. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated
 attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE.
 Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read
 access to a subset of Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability
 applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java
 Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run
 untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the
 Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java
 deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code
 (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS v3.0 Base Score 3.7

Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the 2D component in Oracle Java SE and Java
 for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update 25, and 1.4.2_27 allows remote
 attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via
 unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the
 October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable
 researcher that this is an integer overflow that triggers memory corruption
 via large values in a subsample of a JPEG image, related to
 JPEGImageWriter.writeImage in the imageio API.
Ubuntu-Description:
  It was discovered that improper checks of unspecified image metadata
  in JPEGImageWriter.writeImage of the imageio API could allow an
  attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running a java applet or application.
Notes:
  sbeattie> red hat description: JPEGImageWriter.writeImage in the
  imageio API improperly checked certain image metadata, which could
  allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context
  of the user running the applet or application.
